We demonstrated\nC. glutamicum\nas an efficient microbial host for utilizing diverse carbon substrates present in biomass hydrolysates, such as glucose, arabinose, and xylose, in addition to its natural ability to assimilate lignin-derived aromatics. As a case study to demonstrate its bioproduction capabilities, L-lactate was chosen as the primary fermentation end product along with acetate and succinate.\nC. glutamicum\nwas found to grow well in different aromatics (benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, vanillic acid, and p-coumaric acid) up to a concentration of 40 mM. Besides,\n13\nC-fingerprinting confirmed that carbon from aromatics enter the primary metabolism via TCA cycle confirming the presence of β-ketoadipate pathway in\nC. glutamicum\n.\n13\nC-fingerprinting in the presence of both glucose and aromatics also revealed coumarate to be the most preferred aromatic by\nC. glutamicum\ncontributing 74 and 59% of its carbon for the synthesis of glutamate and aspartate respectively.\n13\nC-fingerprinting also confirmed the activity of ortho-cleavage pathway, anaplerotic pathway, and cataplerotic pathways. Finally, the engineered\nC. glutamicum\nstrain grew well in biomass hydrolysate containing pentose and hexose sugars and produced L-lactate at a concentration of 47.9 g/L and a yield of 0.639 g/g from sugars with simultaneous utilization of aromatics. Succinate and acetate co-products were produced at concentrations of 8.9 g/L and 3.2 g/L, respectively. Our findings open the door to valorize all the major carbon components of biomass hydrolysate by using\nC. glutamicum\nas a microbial host for biomanufacturing.\nIntroduction\nResearch efforts are underway worldwide for production of biofuels and chemicals from various renewable resources as a sustainable alternative to fossil resources (\nZhou et al., 2008\n;\nZhou et al., 2011\n;\nVarman et al., 2013\n;\nSalvachua et al., 2015\n;\nLiu et al., 2017\n;\nWu et al., 2017\n). Amongst the various renewable resources that are currently being investigated, lignocellulosic biomass represents the largest net resource with a worldwide annual production of 200 billion tons (\nSimmons et al., 2008\n;\nTuck et al., 2012\n). Industrial biotechnology, wherein microbial strains are utilized for coupled bioconversion of various carbon substrates present in biomass, is expected to provide a scalable and cost-competitive production method for renewable fuels and chemicals (\nSievert et al., 2017\n;\nFlores et al., 2020\n;\nAbdel-Rahman et al., 2021\n;\nFlores et al., 2021\n;\nWu et al., 2021\n;\nZan et al., 2021\n). However, several challenges still need to be overcome for efficient bioconversion of biomass to bioproducts. The first challenge is the structural heterogeneity of lignocellulosic biomass, resulting in hydrolysates that contain diverse substrates such as sugars, organic acids and aromatics as the main depolymerized components (\nBruijnincx, 2014\n;\nSocha et al., 2014\n). Furthermore, aromatics derived from hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass can be inhibitory to the growth of common model microbial conversion hosts such as\nEscherichia coli\nand\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n(\nFitzgerald et al., 2004\n;\nAdeboye et al., 2014\n;\nVarman et al., 2018\n). Although significant progress is underway for utilization of each of the potential fermentation substrates, the diversity of these substrates can result in spiralling costs for upstream separations, supplementation of fermentation medium, serial fermentation steps, and product purification. From a techno-economic perspective, bottlenecks associated with any one of these unit operations can tip the scales against economic viability for a promising biotechnology. Process integration provides a means for achieving dramatic improvements in reaction kinetics, yields, product titers, and separations, thereby minimizing cost and risk associated with biomanufacturing (\nVan Gerven and Stankiewicz, 2009\n). One-way bioprocess integration could be achieved for valorization of lignocellulosic biomass is by employing omnivorous microbial cell factories that can utilize diverse carbon substrates present in biomass hydrolysates.\nCorynebacterium glutamicum\nis a fast growing, aerobic, and non-pathogenic Gram-positive soil bacterium exhibiting physiological traits that could make it an interesting alternative to these model microbes for the reasons discussed below.\nC. glutamicum\nnaturally has a wide substrate range and has been further engineered to uptake other carbon substrates such as xylose and arabinose (\nKawaguchi et al., 2008\n;\nXia et al., 2016\n). Owing to the industrial importance of\nC. glutamicum\n, the genomes of several of its strains have been sequenced (\nIkeda and Nakagawa, 2003\n;\nKalinowski et al., 2003\n;\nYukawa et al., 2007\n;\nLv et al., 2011\n). The availability of genetic data for\nC. glutamicum\nled to the discovery of genetic clusters encoding aromatic degradation pathways with the aid of genomic bioinformatics. As\nC. glutamicum\npossesses catabolic pathways for the utilization of all major aromatic compounds present in biomass hydrolysates, it can be grown in the presence of lignin-derived aromatics (\nShen et al., 2005\n;\nSakai et al., 2007\n). Moreover,\nC. glutamicum\nis known to secrete L-lactate, succinate, and amino acids at higher concentrations as fermentation end products from glucose due to its robust glycolytic pathway (\nWieschalka et al., 2012\n;\nTsuge et al., 2019b\n). Because of these remarkable features,\nC. glutamicum\nwas selected as a development target for investigation of microbial omnivory in bioprocessing.\nAmongst the various lignocellulosic biomass available in United States, corn stover (the biomass residue left from harvest of the corn from\nZea mays\n) represents both a cheap and an abundant biomass feedstock available for bioconversion. As found in other plant biomass, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin make up 70–90% of its biochemical constituents (\nSaha, 2003\n;\nWang, 2007\n;\nÖhgren et al., 2007\n;\nGirio et al., 2010\n). Through mechanical, chemical or biochemical pretreatment, these biopolymers can be converted into the corresponding monomers, such as glucose, xylose, arabinose, and various aromatics (\nChen et al., 2016\n). These monomers can in turn be used as carbon substrates in bioprocessing for conversion into fungible fuels and chemicals by a suitable biocatalyst like\nC. glutamicum\n.\nMixed-acid fermentation products containing lactate, succinate, and acetate have gained significant attention due to their potential application as platform chemicals for manufacturing of biobased chemicals and materials. Succinate has been identified as one of the top 12 building block chemicals by the U.S. Department of Energy, with various applications in the pharmaceutical, food, and agricultural indutries (\nZheng et al., 2012\n;\nMeng et al., 2016\n;\nFlores et al., 2020\n). L-lactate, one of the two lactate optical isomers, is mainly used in the production of a bio-based polymer poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA). Stereochemistry of lactate has a significant effect on the material properties of polylactic acid (PLA). The two common types of polylactic acid are poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) and poly-D-lactic acid (PDLA). Both types of lactic acids are semicrystalline polymers. However, the PDLA obtained from the racemic mixtures is amorphous (\nCasalini et al., 2019\n). PLLA is used as a packaging material for fresh fruit containers, drinking cups, lamination films, and other items that can replace petroleum derived plastics. In the present study, by using\nC. glutamicum\nas a microbial host we demonstrate bioproduction of L-lactate, succinate, and acetate from corn stover biomass hydrolysates with simultaneous utilization of sugars and aromatics (\nFigure 1\n). As aromatics metabolic pathways are not well understood in\nC. glutamicum,\n13\nC-fingerprinting studies have been used to throw more light on the aromatics metabolic pathway and thereby, aid future engineering efforts.\nFIGURE 1\nFIGURE 1\n. Schematic representation of the overall process employed in this study. Corn stover was subjected to deacetylation and mechanical refining (DMR) to obtain liquid biomass hydrolysate. The hydrolysate constituting glucose, xylose, arabinose, and aromatics was used as fermentation feedstock for\nC. glutamicum\nto produce mixed acids having various applications.\nMaterials and Methods\nChemicals and Reagents\nAll organic solvents, glucose, xylose, arabinose, aromatics, and other chemicals used in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, United States).\n13\nC labeled glucose was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Tewksbury, MA, United States). The biomass hydrolysate used in this study was obtained from NREL and used without any further processing, unless otherwise stated. In brief, the biomass hydrolysate used in this study was obtained by dilute alkali-based Deacetylation and Mechanical Refining (DMR) pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis technology developed at NREL (\nChen et al., 2016\n).\nBacterial Strains and Plasmids\nC. glutamicum\nATCC 13032 was used as the microbial host in this work (\nKalinowski et al., 2003\n).\nE. coli\nTOP10 was used as the host for all plasmids constructed in this study. Genetic manipulations were carried out by following standard procedures (\nSambrook and Russell, 2001\n). The plasmids pEKEx-xylAxc-xylBec and pVWE1araBAD provided by Dr. Wendisch (Bielefeld University) were used for the metabolic engineering of\nC. glutamicum\nto enable xylose and arabinose utilization (\nSchneider et al., 2010\n;\nMeiswinkel et al., 2013\n). All the plasmids and bacterial strains used in this study are listed in\nTable 1\n.\nTABLE 1\nTABLE 1\n. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study.\nTransformation\nTransformation of\nC. glutamicum\nwas conducted for construction of SSL03 and SSL09 strains as described previously (\nvan der Rest et al., 1999\n;\nEggeling and Bott, 2005\n) with minor modifications. Briefly, overnight cultures of\nC. glutamicum\nwere inoculated into a 1L conical flask containing 100 ml of BHIS medium (brain-heart infusion medium containing 91 g/L sorbitol) and grown at 30°C until the optical density at 600 nm [OD\n600\n] reached between 0.9 and 1.0. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold 10% (v/v) glycerol. Finally, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 10% (v/v) glycerol. For each transformation, 100 μL of the cells was mixed with at least 100 ng of DNA. Electroporation was then performed in a 0.2 cm electroporation cuvette and electroporation was done with a gene pulser system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA), operated at 25 uF, 200 Ω and 2.5 kV, 5 ms. The electroporated cells were immediately transferred to 1 ml of fresh BHIS medium and recovered at 30°C for 2 h. Subsequently, the cultures were then plated onto a BHIS agar plate containing appropriate antibiotics. Recombinant colonies usually appeared after 24 h of plating. Single colonies were propagated on a fresh brain heart infusion (BHI) liquid medium containing appropriate antibiotics to serve as inoculum for conducting fermentation experiments.\nMedia and Culture Conditions\nE. coli\nstrains were cultivated in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and/or spectinomycin (100 μg/ml) as required at 37°C in a shaker at 200 rpm or on solidified LB plates.\nC. glutamicum\nstrains were cultured in BHI medium or BTM2 medium (modified from BT medium) as required (\nKawaguchi et al., 2006\n). For L-lactate production, the cells were grown in BTM2 medium. The BTM2 medium composition is as follows (per liter): (NH\n4\n)\n2\nSO\n4\n7 g, KH\n2\nPO\n4\n0.5 g, K\n2\nHPO\n4\n0.5 g, MgSO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO 0.5 g, urea 2 g, NaHCO\n3\n8.4 g, 1 × vitamin solution, and 1 × trace metal solution. The 1,000x trace metal solution (per liter) contained FeSO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO 6 g, MnSO\n4\n.H\n2\nO 10 g, ZnSO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO 0.56 g, CuSO\n4\n.5H\n2\nO 0.2 g, and 1,000x vitamin solution (per liter) contained biotin 4 g and thiamine 4 g. In addition, the BTM2 medium was supplemented with 2% MOPS to provide additional buffering capacity during L-lactate production (\nRouabhia et al., 2014\n). BHI agar plates were supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and spectinomycin (200 μg/ml) as required to obtain colonies of the engineered strains at 30°C.\nSingle colonies were inoculated into 5 ml of BHI medium and cultured overnight in 50 ml culture tubes at 30°C and 250 rpm. For the fermentation experiments, 1% of the overnight seed culture was inoculated into BTM2 containing 4% glucose or aromatics (benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, vanillic acid, and p-coumaric acid) at varying concentrations and grown for 5 days at 30°C and 250 rpm.\nAnalytical Methods\nGrowth of\nC. glutamicum\nwas monitored by measuring optical density of cultures at 600 nm with an Infinite 200 Pro plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). Estimation of glucose, xylose, arabinose, acetate, L-lactate, and succinate concentration in culture broths were analyzed using HPLC. The supernatants were collected, filtered, and injected onto an ion exchange HPLC column at 70\no\nC under an isocratic condition with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using 0.005 M sulfuric acid in water as solvent. Compounds were monitored by a refractive index detector in positive mode (kept at 40°C) and their concentrations were calculated by integration of peak areas and comparison to a calibration curve prepared from pure standards. Furthermore, enzyme based D (-)/L (+) lactic acid detection kit (R-biopharm) was used to verify the optical purity of L-lactate.\nFor aromatics analysis, supernatant liquid obtained from above was analyzed by an Agilent Technologies 1,260 Infinity II HPLC system equipped with an Agilent Eclipse Plus Phenyl-Hexyl column (250 mm length, 4.6 mm diameter, 5 µm particle size). The mobile phase gradient profile was as follows: 30% B (0 min; 0.5 ml/min), 80% B (12 min; 0.5 ml/min), 100% B (12.1 min; 0.5 ml/min), 100% B (12.6 min; 1 ml/min), 30% B (12.8 min; 1 ml/min), 30% B (15.6 min; 1 ml/min), where solvent A was 10 mM ammonium acetate in water and solvent B was 10 mM ammonium acetate in 90% acetonitrile. Sample injection volumes of 5 µL and a column temperature of 50°C were used. Prior to analysis, samples were filtered through 0.45 µm centrifuge filters. Compounds were monitored by a UV detector and their concentrations were calculated by integration of peak areas and comparison to a calibration curve prepared from pure standards.\nFermentation Culture Conditions\nBatch fermentation experiments were conducted in 1 L bioreactors with 500 ml working volume (Bioflo 115, New Brunswick Scientific Inc., Enfield, CT, United States).\nC. glutamicum\nwas grown in BHI broth until the OD\n600\nvalue reached ∼3 and was used as inoculum. Batch fermentations were conducted by the addition of 1% (v/v) inoculum to the fermenter containing 500 ml of BTM2 medium with 40 g/L of glucose. pH was maintained at seven by adding 25% Ca(OH)\n2\n. Fed-batch fermentations experiment were conducted by the addition of glucose at 72 h. All other fermentation conditions were identical to the batch fermentation experiments. Aerobic fermentation was conducted by sparging the cultures with air at 1 vvm and by continuously stirring the culture at 300 rpm. Anaerobic conditions were maintained by growing the cells without sparging air or oxygen. It can be verified from\nSupplementary Figure S2\nthat growing the cultures without sparging air or oxygen allowed the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels to be maintained at 0% except for the initial 10–12 h period.\nA batch fermentation experiment with DMR hydrolysate was conducted with\nC. glutamicum\nSSL09 in a 1-L fermenter with 500 ml working volume (Bioflo 115, New Brunswick Scientific Inc., Enfield, CT, United States). The other fermentation conditions were identical to the batch fermentation experiment, with pH maintained at seven by adding 25% Ca(OH)\n2\n. Similarly, a batch fermentation experiment was conducted with BTM2 medium supplemented with pure sugars i.e. 40 g/L glucose, 20 g/L xylose, and 10 g/L arabinose supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and spectinomycin (200 μg/ml). The rest other fermentation conditions were identical to the batch fermentation experiment conducted above.\n13\nC Labeling Studies to Decipher Carbon Contribution by Aromatics\nAs a first step,\nC. glutamicum\nseed cultures were grown in BHI medium as described previously. Cells were centrifuged and washed with minimal medium to avoid any carryover of carbon substrates and nutrients from BHI medium. For the labeling study, 50 µL of washed cells were inoculated into 5 ml of BTM2 medium containing 5 g/L [U-\n13\nC] glucose and/or different aromatics at 20 mM concentration. Likewise, 2.5 g/L [U-\n13\nC] xylose with 9.25 g/L BHI in BTM2 minimal medium was used to investigate the presence of catabolic pathways for metabolizing xylose in\nC. glutamicum\n. Bacterial cells were harvested at the end of third day and the biomass was hydrolyzed to obtain proteinogenic amino acids. The amino acids were derivatized with TBDMS (N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyl-trifluoroacetamide, Sigma-Aldrich) by following previously reported protocols (\nYou et al., 2012\n;\nVarman et al., 2014\n). The derivatized amino acids were analyzed for their mass isotopomer abundance by GC-MS, as described elsewhere (\nXiao et al., 2012\n;\nYou et al., 2012\n). The m/z ion [M-57]\n+\nthat corresponds to the entire amino acid was used to calculate the mass fraction of labeled and unlabeled amino acids. m0, m1,…., mn represents mass distribution vector, where m0 is mass fraction of amino acids with zero labeled carbon, m1 is mass fraction of amino acids with one labeled carbon, and so on. The m/z of [M-15]\n+\nwas used for leucine and isoleucine since their [M-57]\n+\noverlaps with other mass peaks (\nWahl et al., 2004\n). The natural abundance of isotopes, including\n13\nC (1.13%),\n18\nO (0.20%),\n29\nSi (4.70%), and\n30\nSi (3.09%) contributes noise to the mass isotopomer spectrum. This background noise was rectified in the calculation of the mass distribution vector using a published algorithm and the detailed correction protocol can be found elsewhere (\nTang et al., 2009\n).\n13\nC fraction (\n13\nC carbons/total carbons) for amino acids were calculated using following formula (\nXiao et al., 2013\n):\n13\nC\nfraction\n=\n1\n/\nn\n∑\nk\n=\n0\nn\nk*m\nk\n, where “n” is maximum number of carbons in the amino acid, m\nk\nis mass fraction of amino acids with “k” number of labeled carbon.\nResults and Discussion\nBioreactor Studies for Mixed Acid Production From Glucose\nGlucose is the primary carbon substrate for\nC. glutamicum,\nwhich is assimilated through central metabolism and leads to the formation of various fermentation end products such as L-lactate, succinate, and acetate (\nInui et al., 2004\n;\nTsuge et al., 2015\n). L-lactate is produced from pyruvate and succinate is produced in the TCA cycle, whereas acetate is formed via acetyl-CoA (\nFigure 2\n). Fermentations with 40 g/L of glucose in BTM2 medium were performed to evaluate the L-lactate fermentation ability of\nC. glutamicum\nunder aerobic and anaerobic conditions. As shown in\nFigure 3A\n, after 120 h of fermentation, 16.2 g/L of L-lactate was produced under anaerobic conditions along with 0.9 g/L and 3.1 g/L of acetate and succinate, respectively. Aerobic fermentation produced 9.8 g/L of L-lactate at a yield of 0.265 g/g from glucose, in comparison to 0.42 g/g obtained in the anaerobic fermentation (\nTable 2\nand\nFigure 3B\n. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate (precursor for L-lactate) produced in the glycolytic pathway is further metabolized in the citric acid cycle, thereby reducing the availability of pyruvate for lactate production. In the absence of oxygen, pyruvate is instantaneously converted to L-lactate (\nOkino et al., 2008\n;\nChai et al., 2016\n). As a result, higher yields and titers of L-lactate were observed under anaerobic conditions.\nFIGURE 2\nFIGURE 2\n. Overview of natural and engineered metabolic pathways for the production of mixed acids (succinate, acetate and lactate) from diverse carbon substrates (xylose, arabinose, glucose, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, vanillic acid, p-coumaric acid) in\nC. glutamicum.\nAssimilation of xylose to be facilitated by XylA (xylose isomerase) and XylB (xylulose kinase) denoted by pink in the figure and assimilation of arabinose facilitated by AraA (arabinose isomerase), AraB (ribolokinase) and AraD (ribulose 5-phosphate 4-epimerase) denoted by purple. Abbreviations in arabinose and xylose assimilation Rib5P (ribulose 5-phosphate), Xyl5P (D-xylulose 5-phosphate), G6P (glucose 6-phosphate), F6P (fructose 6-phosphate), 3PG (3-phosphoglycerate). Succinate is synthesized through the reductive branch of TCA cycle from pyruvate or PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate) under anaerobic conditions (\nShirai et al., 2007\n;\nThakker et al., 2012\n). Acetate is synthesized from acetyl-CoA and L-lactate is synthesized via pyruvate. Aromatic catabolic pathway represented by red arrows. Anaplerotic pathways denoted by dotted lines.\nFIGURE 3\nFIGURE 3\n. Effect of different fermentation cultivation parameters on mixed-acids production by\nC. glutamicum.\nData is shown for single fed batch fermentation.\n(A)\nAnaerobic, batch, no pH control, BTM2 supplemented with glucose;\n(B)\nAerobic, batch, no pH control, BTM2 supplemented with glucose;\n(C)\nAnaerobic, batch, pH 7, BTM2 supplemented with glucose;\n(D)\nAnaerobic, fed-batch: 40 g/L (0 h) + 30 g/L (72 h), pH 7, BTM2;\n(E)\nAnaerobic with initial aeration for 16 h, fed-batch: 40 g/L (0 h) + 30 g/L (72 h), pH 7, BTM2.\nTABLE 2\nTABLE 2\n. Fermentation kinetics of different cultivation strategies employed for production of mixed acids.\nEnergy metabolism in\nC. glutamicum\ngets impaired when the pH is maintained below six or above 8.5 owing to the non-generation of proton motive force (pmf) (\nFollmann et al., 2009\n). Therefore, it is crucial to maintain an optimal pH to maximize flux through the energy metabolism and to increase the product titer. Therefore, pH dependence of product formation was investigated at identical substrate loading to evaluate L-lactate production under chemo statically controlled neutral pH (pH 7). Ca(OH)\n2\nhas been effectively used as a low cost neutralizing agent in the production of L-lactate (\nZhu et al., 2007\n;\nNakano et al., 2012\n;\nLiu et al., 2014\n). Downstream processing for the recovery of L-lactate from calcium precipitate is also established, and generally performed with the addition of sulfuric acid. Therefore, pH was maintained with the addition of 25% Ca(OH)\n2.\nAs shown in\nFigure 3C\n, 38.6 g/L of L-lactate was produced after 120 h with an increase in L-lactate yield to 0.932 g/g glucose. In addition, acetate and succinate were also produced in small amounts as byproducts at a titer of 2 g/L and 8.1 g/L, respectively. Downstream seperations of mixed acids can be successfully performed using the emulsion liquid membrane and adsorbent resins method as shown by\nLee and Kim (2011)\nand\nNam et al. (2012)\n. Acetate and succinate along with L-lactate have extensive industrial applications and present work investigates\nC. glutamicum’s\nability to produce organic acids from lignocellulosic substrates.\nAfter establishing batch culture setup, further work focused on setting up a fed batch culture to check if fed batch culture will lead to higher mixed acid yields. A fed-batch fermentation was carried out with addition of 40 ml of 400 g/L glucose stock solution to the fermentation broth at 72 h, and fermentation was continued for another 120 h. In the end of the fermentation time course, 52.8 g/L of L-lactate (0.71 g/g glucose) was produced with 3.1 g/L of acetate and 12.4 g/L of succinate (\nFigure 3D\n). To further enhance the L-lactate production, fermentation was performed in high density cultures. Towards this end, aeration was performed for initial 16 h to enhance the cell growth at the beginning of the fermentation and to accumulate microbial biomass. Aeration was ceased and 40 ml of 400 g/L glucose was added at 72 h of fermentation. Under these conditions, 54.1 g/L of L-lactate was produced with 2.7 g/L of acetate and 14 g/L of succinate with corresponding yield of L-lactate 0.758 g/g, and productivity of 0.322 g/L/h (\nFigure 3E\n). No further improvements in L-lactate yield suggests the presence of pathway bottlenecks and can be resolved by established metabolic engineering approaches for lactate synthesis (\nPapagianni, 2012\n;\nUpadhyaya et al., 2014\n;\nTsuge et al., 2015\n), which is not the primary focus of this study.\nUtilization of Aromatic Compounds in\nC. Glutamicum\nTo date, numerous advances have been made for efficient bioconversion of monomers derived from cellulosic and hemicellulosic biomass components (\nTsuge et al., 2019a\n).\nC. glutamicum\ncan play a major role in bioconversion of lignin-derived aromatics since it is highly tolerant to the presence of aromatics and it can grow by utilizing aromatics as the only carbon substrate (\nFigure 2\n) (\nShen et al., 2012\n). In this context, genomic and proteomic analysis confirm the presence of genes and proteins for the utilization of aromatics through various peripheral pathways as shown in\nFigure 2\n(\nShen et al., 2012\n). Although it is known that the aromatic metabolic pathways are present, growth of\nC. glutamicum\nin the presence of aromatics has not being well characterized and the upper limit of aromatics concentration at which\nC. glutamicum\nstill grows is unknown (\nDing et al., 2015\n;\nKallscheuer et al., 2016\n). Therefore, to further understand the limits of aromatics utilization,\nC. glutamicum\nstrains were cultured in BTM2 medium containing various lignin derived aromatics (vanillic acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid and p-coumaric acid), in varying concentrations (10 mM, 20 mM, and 40 mM).\nC. glutamicum\nshowed two folds higher growth in the presence of benzoic acid and p-coumaric acid as substrates compared to vanillic acid and cinnamic acid (\nFigure 4\n). Cells showed growth up to 40 mM concentration for all the aromatics which indicates high tolerance as well as successful utilization of lignin derived aromatics by\nC. glutamicum\n. Previous studies on\nC. glutamicum\nhave tested its growth at lower aromatics concentration of 5–10 mM (\nDing et al., 2015\n;\nKallscheuer et al., 2016\n), and therefore, the present findings further expand the aromatics concentration limit for\nC. glutamicum\n. This is important from the context of lignin valorization as biomass hydrolysates on an average contain higher (more than 10 mM) lignin derived aromatics (\nLinger et al., 2014\n;\nRodriguez et al., 2017\n;\nGomes and Rodrigues, 2019\n;\nSalvachúa et al., 2020\n). In comparison, other microbial hosts being studied for the bioconversion of aromatics such as\nPseudomonas putida\nKT2440,\nP. putida\nmt-2,\nRhodococcus jostii\nRHA1, and\nSphingobium\nsp. SYK-6 have been tested at aromatic concentrations less than 10 mM (\nChen et al., 2012\n;\nVarman et al., 2016\n;\nRavi et al., 2017\n;\nKohlstedt et al., 2018\n;\nAlmqvist et al., 2021\n;\nSpence et al., 2021\n). This remarkable ability of\nC. glutamicum\nto naturally resist as well as assimilate high concentrations of aromatics makes it an ideal choice for the bioconversion of multiple substrates present in biomass hydrolysates.\nFIGURE 4\nFIGURE 4\n. Growth assays of\nC. glutamicum\nin:\n(A)\nvanillic acid (10, 20, 40 mM),\n(B)\nBenzoic acid (10, 20, 40 mM),\n(C)\nCinnamic acid (10, 20, 40 mM), and\n(D)\np-coumaric acid (10, 20, 40 mM). The experiments were performed in biological triplicates. Data represents mean ± SD,\nn\n= 3.\n13\nC-Fingerprinting to Decipher Pathways for the Utilization of Lignin-Derived Aromatics\nTo further elucidate the aromatics metabolic pathways,\n13\nC-fingerprinting was performed. Specifically, [U-\n13\nC] glucose was fed to\nC. glutamicum\nalong with the following unlabeled aromatics: p-coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, benzoic acid, and cinnamic acid in four independent batch cultures. The\n13\nC-labeling analysis revealed that in comparison to the cultures fed with only labeled glucose, the cultures that were fed with both labeled glucose and aromatics showed a reduction in the labeling fraction of the amino acids (\nFigure 5\n). Interestingly, a minor reduction in labeled fraction was observed for cultures that were fed with only [U-\n13\nC] glucose. This can be attributed to the unlabeled carbon that entered via CO\n2\nthrough anaplerotic pathways (PEP → OAA, pyruvate→OAA) (\nShirai et al., 2007\n). This in turn contributed to unlabeled carbon in amino acids derived from TCA cycle such as glutamate and aspartate. These results confirm that\nC. glutamicum\nis able to effectively metabolize the aromatics and incorporate the carbon from the aromatics into cell biomass components. Interestingly, amino acids synthesized from the TCA cycle showed the highest reduction in the labeled carbon fraction (\nFigure 5B\n). This finding confirms that the unlabeled carbon skeletons from aromatics entered the primary metabolism via succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA derived from the β-ketoadipate pathway, as shown in\nFigure 5A\n(\nShen et al., 2012\n).\nFIGURE 5\nFIGURE 5\n.\n13\nC-fingerprinting study for tracing aromatic assimilation. Fully labeled [U-\n13\nC] Glucose (5 g/L) in BTM 2 medium was used in culturing\nC. glutamicum\nstrain along with 20 mM concentration of aromatics to study aromatic preference in\nC. glutamicum\nstrain.\n(A)\nLignin derived aromatics (p-coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, vanillic acid, and benzoic acid) assimilation determination by tracing reduction in labeled fraction in key amino acids (alanine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid).

The experiments were performed in biological triplicates. Data represents mean ± SD,\nn\n= 3.\n(B)\nHeatmap depicting variation in labeled fraction in different amino acids where Glucose only: [U-\n13\nC] Glucose (5 g/L) in BTM 2 medium batch; GCA: [U-\n13\nC] Glucose (5 g/L) + 20 mM cinnamic acid in BTM 2 medium batch; GCO: [U-\n13\nC] Glucose (5 g/L) + 20 mM p-coumaric acid in BTM 2 medium batch; GVA: [U-\n13\nC] Glucose (5 g/L) + 20 mM vanillic acid in BTM 2 medium batch; GBA: [U-\n13\nC] Glucose (5 g/L) + 20 mM benzoic acid in BTM 2 medium batch.\nUbiquitous reduction in labeled fraction was observed in all four aromatics used in the present study. Amongst the various aromatics that were tested, the highest reduction in carbon labelling was observed with p-coumaric acid followed by cinnamic acid, benzoic acid and least in vanillic acid (\nFigure 5B\n). Specifically, labeling of glutamic acid and aspartic acid significantly reduced by 67 and 48%, respectively. However, alanine labeling was reduced by only 24%, which is strong evidence that carbon is entering the TCA cycle without being converted into pyruvate directly. This also suggest that p-coumaric acid is the aromatic preferred by\nC. glutamicum\n, which agrees with the higher growth rate observed in p-coumaric acid fed cultures compared to the other aromatics (\nFigure 5D\n). Interestingly, the p-coumaric acid catabolic pathway involves a greater number of steps compared to the catabolic pathways of vanillic acid or benzoic acid. One potential explanation can be that\nC. glutamicum\nhas highly active enzymes in the coumarate catabolic pathway, resulting in better uptake and breakdown of coumarate. Another possibility is that the coumarate catabolic pathway is upregulated under these conditions compared to the other aromatics. Furthermore, these results are congruent with the growth assay results reported in\nFigure 4\n, which showed highest growth in the presence of p-coumaric acid among all the other aromatics that were tested. These results can be leveraged for the further engineering of\nC. glutamicum\nas we aspire to increase the catabolism of all aromatics simultaneously for increased production of aromatics derived fuels and chemicals. The p-coumaric acid catabolic pathway is a three-step process leading to the formation of protocatechuate as an intermediate. Protocatechuate is also an intermediate for both vanillate and cinnamate catabolic pathways. In general, protocatechuate degradation occurs via three different pathways known as the ortho, meta, and para cleavage pathways. Meta and para cleavage pathways provide pyruvate as an intermediate prior to the carbon entering the TCA cycle. Alanine labelling in an organism can be used to confirm the presence of these pathways, since alanine is directly biosynthesized from pyruvate. From\nFigure 5\n, it can be observed that aspartate and glutamate had higher reduction in labelling as compared to alanine which demonstrates that carbon enters the TCA cycle without being diverted through pyruvate. Therefore, this work confirms that the ortho-cleavage protocatechuate pathway is active in\nC. glutamicum\n, in agreement with the previous genomic studies (\nShen et al., 2012\n;\nKallscheuer et al., 2016\n). Furthermore, the 10–15% reduction in labeling fraction of alanine indicate that cataplerotic pathways are also active in\nC. glutamicum\n.\nC. glutamicum\nhas long been used for the production of amino acids, including glutamic acid and lysine. The present study shows that glutamic acid is highly labeled compared to aspartic acid, both derived from TCA cycle intermediates. This trend was consistent in all of the labeling studies that were performed with the various aromatics. A likely explanation for this observation is the presence of anaplerotic pathways, through which labeled carbon from pyruvate and phosphoenolpyruvate enters oxaloacetate to produce aspartic acid (\nVarman et al., 2016\n). Also, as\nC. glutamicum\nis a natural producer of glutamic acid, the flux from α-ketoglutarate to glutamate may be more robust, thereby restricting the unlabeled carbon flow from α-ketoglutarate to oxaloacetate. Overall, the\n13\nC analysis performed improves our understanding of aromatic catabolism in\nC. glutamicum,\nand provides strong evidence that aromatics present in lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates can be used as carbon substrates for the bioproduction of L-lactate using this chassis.\nMixed-Acid Production From Corn Stover Hydrolysate\nIn the above sections, we have established fermentation of mixed acids in the presence of glucose as well as gained a better understanding of the aromatics metabolism in\nC. glutamicum.\nAs a next step conducting fermentation with actual biomass hydrolysates containing diverse substrates will establish\nC. glutamicum\nas a omnivorous host for bioproduction. However, several of the previous studies have reported that\nC. glutamicum\nlacks the ability to catabolize xylose. On the other hand, whole genome sequencing has confirmed the presence of\nxylB\nthat encodes for xylulokinase, but its function was never studied (\nKawaguchi et al., 2006\n). This led us to wonder if the other genes of the xylose pathway are present in\nC. glutamicum\nbut are not yet known. Therefore, to investigate the presence of xylose pathway in\nC. glutamicum\n13\nC isotopomer analysis was performed by feeding the cells with [U-\n13\nC] xylose. We observed that there was no change in MDV levels for cells grown with labeled xylose in comparison to cells that were grown without labeled xylose (\nSupplementary Figure S3\n). The absence of labelling conclusively proves that\nC. glutamicum\nlacks the ability to metabolize xylose under the conditions tested in the laboratory. Therefore, it was essential to impart\nC. glutamicum\nthe ability to grown on pentose sugars. Towards this, the genes\nxylA\n,\nxylB\nof xylose pathway, and the genes\naraA\n,\naraB\n,\naraD\nof arabinose pathway were transformed into the\nC. glutamicum\nATCC 13032 strain resulting into the strain SSL09 (\nSchneider et al., 2010\n;\nMeiswinkel et al., 2013\n). Also, to evaluate the growth of\nC. glutamicum\nin the presence of biomass hydrolysates, the wild-type strain was grown in the presence of varying volume ratios of the hydrolysate. Biomass hydrolysates contain chemicals like furfurals and hydroxymethylfurfurals (HMF) which can be inhibitory to growth of bacterial cells (\nTsuge et al., 2014\n;\nChen et al., 2016\n;\nKuhn et al., 2020\n). However, DMR hydrolysate has been processed to remove these inhibitors (\nChen et al., 2016\n).\nC. glutamicum\nwas found to be tolerant to the presence of aromatics and other unknown inhibitory chemicals present in corn stover biomass hydrolysates (DMR) (\nChen et al., 2016\n), growing well even in the presence of 80% hydrolysates (\nSupplementary Figure S1\n). However, the maximum growth rate was observed in the presence of 20% (vol/vol) of biomass hydrolysate, therefore this hydrolysate concentration was chosen for further experiments.\nAnaerobic fermentation experiments were carried out using wild-type\nC. glutamicum\nand engineered SSL09 strains in BTM2 medium supplemented with glucose, xylose, and arabinose as carbon substrates. As seen in\nFigure 6A\n, complete utilization of glucose was observed in 168 h followed by utilization of arabinose and xylose. Delayed utilization of xylose and arabinose can be associated with the most common catabolite repression phenomenon observed in microorganisms in the presence of multiple carbon substrates (\nDien et al., 2002\n;\nAbdel-Rahman et al., 2015\n;\nFlores et al., 2020\n). Although utilization of pentose sugars happened only after 90 h, other works have shown that through further engineering,\nC. glutamicum\ncan be made to utilize both pentose and hexose sugars simultaneously (\nSasaki et al., 2016\n). Lactate (31.5 g/L) along with acetate (2 g/L) and succinate (8.1 g/L) were produced at 168 h.\nFigure 6B\nshows the fermentation profile using DMR corn stover hydrolysate as a fermentation medium. Lactate 47.9 g/L along with acetate 3.2 g/L and succinate 8.9 g/L were produced with complete utilization of glucose in 144 h. Utilization of xylose (17%), arabinose (60%), glucose (100%) lead to production of acetate (2 g/L), L-lactate (31.5 g/L) and succinate (8.1 g/L) in SSL09 strain this shows active utilization of pentose and hexose sugar utilization for production of mixed acids. At the end of the fermentation time course, the yield of lactate from sugars available in DMR hydrolysate was 0.639 g/g of the total, and productivity was 0.285 g/L/h. Furthermore,\nC. glutamicum\nshowed good growth in DMR hydrolysate and lead to reduction in aromatics levels (\nFigure 6C\n). In this fermentation trial, it was observed that the strain completely consumed the aromatics ferulic acid, vanillin, and benzoic acid which were present in DMR hydrolysate (\nFigure 6C\n). Although, we have demonstrated the production of mixed acids from 20% biomass hydrolysate, using high biomass concentration as feedstock is preferred from an industrial standpoint. However, the DMR hydrolysate used in this study contains very high total sugar concentration, 230 g/L (\nChen et al., 2016\n). Growing\nC. glutamicum\nat high sugar concentrations would require adaptive laboratory evolution of the strain. Therefore, future works should focus on utilizing adaptive laboratory evolution to improve the tolerance of\nC. glutamicum\nat high sugar concentrations and further optimization of bioprocess conditions to grow the cells at very high hydrolysate levels. Overall, this work demonstrates the first application of\nC. glutamicum\nto utilize all the diverse carbon substrates present in lignocellulosic biomass for bioproduction of value-added chemicals.\nFIGURE 6\nFIGURE 6\n.

Fermentative processes in a variety of cultivation modes, including an aerobic cell growth and anaerobic fermentation phase, batch, and fed-batch mode, using BTM2 medium with different carbon substrates, and DMR corn stover hydrolysate were evaluated for production of mixed acids from pure sugars as well as biomass hydrolysate. In all cultivation modes, L-lactate was produced in significantly high titers with acetate and succinate as co-products.\nC. glutamicum\nexhibited a maximum productivity of 0.322 g/L/h towards L-lactate with 54.1 g/L when grown aerobically for the first 16 h followed by anaerobic fermentation. Also, utilization of pentose and hexose sugars as well as aromatics present in corn stover hydrolysate for mixed acid production was demonstrated. Furthermore,\nC. glutamicum\nshowed high tolerance and utilization of different aromatics commonly present in lignocellulosic hydrolysate, including benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, vanillic acid, and p-coumaric acid.\n13\nC-fingerprinting confirmed the roles of the ortho-cleavage pathway, anaplerotic pathway, and cataplerotic pathways for utilization of aromatics in the TCA cycle, with p-coumaric acid as the preferred substrate amongst aromatics studied. These findings suggest\nC. glutamicum\nis a versatile omnivorous host for valorization of lignocellulosic feedstocks.\nData Availability Statement\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\nAuthor Contributions\nAV, RD, AM, SS, and AMJ conceived and designed this study.

Biosynthesis of 3-HP is possible; however, low production is typically observed in those natural systems. Biosynthetic pathways have been designed to produce 3-HP from a variety of feedstocks in different microorganisms.\nResults\nIn this study, the 3-HP β-alanine pathway consisting of aspartate decarboxylase, β-alanine-pyruvate aminotransferase, and 3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase from selected microorganisms were codon optimized for\nAspergillus\nspecies and placed under the control of constitutive promoters. The pathway was introduced into\nAspergillus pseudoterreus\nand subsequently into\nAspergillus niger\n, and 3-HP production was assessed in both hosts.\nA. niger\nproduced higher initial 3-HP yields and fewer co-product contaminants and was selected as a suitable host for further engineering. Proteomic and metabolomic analysis of both\nAspergillus\nspecies during 3-HP production identified genetic targets for improvement of flux toward 3-HP including pyruvate carboxylase, aspartate aminotransferase, malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, oxaloacetate hydrolase, and a 3-HP transporter. Overexpression of pyruvate carboxylase improved yield in shake-flasks from 0.09 to 0.12 C-mol 3-HP C-mol\n−1\nglucose in the base strain expressing 12 copies of the β-alanine pathway. Deletion or overexpression of individual target genes in the pyruvate carboxylase overexpression strain improved yield to 0.22 C-mol 3-HP C-mol\n−1\nglucose after deletion of the major malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase. Further incorporation of additional β-alanine pathway genes and optimization of culture conditions (sugars, temperature, nitrogen, phosphate, trace elements) for 3-HP production from deacetylated and mechanically refined corn stover hydrolysate improved yield to 0.48 C-mol 3-HP C-mol\n−1\nsugars and resulted in a final titer of 36.0 g/L 3-HP.\nConclusions\nThe results of this study establish\nA. niger\nas a host for 3-HP production from a lignocellulosic feedstock in acidic conditions and demonstrates that 3-HP titer and yield can be improved by a broad metabolic engineering strategy involving identification and modification of genes participated in the synthesis of 3-HP and its precursors, degradation of intermediates, and transport of 3-HP across the plasma membrane.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nThe genetic basis of 3-hydroxypropanoate metabolism in\nCupriavidus necator\nH16\nArticle\nOpen access\n17 June 2019\nMetabolic engineering of\nKomagataella phaffii\nfor enhanced 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) production from methanol\nArticle\nOpen access\n20 February 2025\nEngineering the synthetic β-alanine pathway in\nKomagataella phaffii\nfor conversion of methanol into 3-hydroxypropionic acid\nArticle\nOpen access\n17 November 2023\nExplore related subjects\nDiscover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\nBiosynthesis\nC3 photosynthesis\nMetabolic Engineering\nMetabolic Pathways\nBiochemical Engineering\nBioprocess Engineering\nUse our pre-submission checklist\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\nBackground\nThe fuel and chemical products obtained from petroleum refineries have been essential in our daily life for more than a century. However, petroleum products are non-renewable and their production and use has contributed to widespread anthropogenic impacts on the earth’s atmosphere, lands, and oceans [\n1\n]. This has prompted the investigation of alternative routes to produce fuels and chemicals at low carbon intensity from renewable feedstocks [\n2\n]. Cost-effective utilization of existing industries to support the transition to alternative production routes for chemicals currently derived from petrochemical feedstocks will require synergistic efforts to maximize the output of biological systems and establish bioprocesses that are economically viable. To accomplish this, an Agile BioFoundry has been established to efficiently address the challenges associated with bioprocess development and engineer microorganisms for production of fuels and chemicals from renewable biomass feedstocks [\n3\n].\n3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is a potential bioderived platform chemicals that can be converted into various commercial use chemicals, such as acrylic acid, malonic acid, 1,3-propanediol, and acrylamide, as well as direct use for production of biodegradable polymers [\n4\n,\n5\n]. Chemical synthesis routes have been explored for 3-HP production, but high costs and adverse environmental impacts have limited chemical synthesis of 3-HP as a bulk chemical [\n6\n]. However, biological fermentation is a potential route for 3-HP production from renewable feedstocks and has been actively investigated for more than a decade [\n7\n,\n8\n]. Naturally, there exist several 3-HP production processes, such as CO\n2\nassimilation in\nChloroflexus aurantiacus\n[\n9\n], cyanobacterium\nSynechocystis\nsp. [\n10\n,\n11\n], glycerol oxidation in\nLactobacillus\nsp. [\n12\n,\n13\n], acrylic acid degradation in\nByssochlamys\nsp. [\n14\n] or\nRhodococcus erythropolis\n[\n15\n], and uracil catabolism in\nSaccharomyces kluyveri\n[\n16\n] or\nE. coli\nK-12 [\n17\n]. However, the efficiency of 3-HP production in native microorganisms is very low. Therefore, genetic engineering of non-native hosts with novel synthetic 3-HP production pathways is actively being evaluated to improve 3-HP production.\nGlycerol oxidation through a coenzyme A-independent pathway was initially detailed by Bieble et al. for 1,3-propanediol production in\nClostridia\nand\nEnterobacteriaceae\nand the NAD\n+\n-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase that can convert 1,3-propanediol to 3-HP in\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\nby Raj et al. [\n18\n,\n19\n].\nE. coli\nor\nK. pneumoniae\nwas genetically engineered and optimized for 3-HP production by combination of glycerol reduction and 3-HP production, which led to 70 to 80 g/l 3-HP production titer in fed-batch fermentations with glycerol as a carbon source [\n20\n,\n21\n].\nBiosynthetic routes to 3-HP via malonyl-CoA and β-alanine have been demonstrated in\nE. coli\n[\n22\n,\n23\n] and further explored or optimized in various microorganisms such as\nE. coli\n, cyanobacteria, and\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n. For example, the malonyl-CoA pathway was introduced into\nE. coli\nfor conversion of glucose to 3-HP, which resulted in 10 g/l 3-HP production in 36 h [\n24\n]. Similar results were observed for the same pathway after integration into the chromosomes of\nS. cerevisiae\nor\nSchizosaccharomyces pombe\n[\n25\n,\n26\n]. The β-alanine 3-HP pathway consisting of aspartate decarboxylase, β-alanine pyruvate transaminase, and 3-HP dehydrogenase was constructed and examined in the\nS. cerevisiae\nwith production titer of 13.4 g/l in controlled fed-batch fermentation [\n27\n]. Recently, we demonstrated that the β-alanine 3-HP pathway was functional in the acidophilic filamentous fungus\nAspergillus pseudoterreus\n[\n28\n].\nFilamentous fungi such as\nAspergillus\nspecies are used industrially for organic acid production because of their ability to grow at very low pH (< 2.0) and produce secreted metabolites in nutrient-limited growth conditions, which eliminates the requirement of medium pH neutralization.\nA. pseudoterreus\ncan secrete more than 80 g/l of itaconic acid in culture medium [\n29\n,\n30\n] and\nAspergillus niger\ncan grow in more than 20% glucose or sucrose and convert more than 90% of the feedstock to citric acid [\n31\n,\n32\n]. In this study, we explored and improved 3-HP production via the β-alanine pathway in the industrial\nAspergillus\nspecies.\nResults\nEvaluation of 3-HP production in\nAspergillus pseudoterreus\nA synthetic β-alanine pathway (3HP) for 3-HP production consisting of\nTribolium castaneum\naspartate decarboxylase (PAND),\nBacillus cereus\nβ-alanine-pyruvate aminotransferase (BAPAT), and\nEscherichia coli\n3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase (HPDH) has been established and demonstrated in\nS. cerevisiae\n[\n27\n] and\nA. pseudoterreus\n[\n28\n]. In this study, we examined the effect of supplementation with trace elements (TE) and complex nutrients on 3-HP production in transgenic strain\nA. pseudoterreus\nAp3HP6 that contains two copies of the β-alanine pathway (Additional file\n1\n: Figs. S1 and S2) since the production medium B (RDM) was originally optimized for itaconic acid production [\n33\n]. Individual or combinations of TE were added to the base culture medium at up to 20-fold the original concentration. Figure\n1\nA shows that both Cu and Fe enhance 3-HP production in modified production medium B (mRDM). However, no synergetic effects were observed when combinations of Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn were added. In addition, supplementation with small amounts of nutrient-rich medium [0.5, 1, or 2 ml CM (complete medium)] substantially reduced 3-HP production.\nFig. 1\nA\nThe effects of different trace elements and CM on 3-HP production in the\nA. pseudoterreus\ntransgenic strain Ap3HP6. The strain was inoculated in the mRDM medium with various amounts of components and grown at 30 °C and 200 rpm. Each data point is the average of three biological replicates.\nB\n. The effects of additional copies of 3HP pathway (3HP::\nhph\n: 3HP4070) or 3HP pathway +\naat1\noverexpression (3HP::\nhph/aat1\n: 3HP4071) on 3-HP production in the\nA. pseudoterreus\ntransgenic strain Ap3HP6 background. The strain was inoculated in the mRDM medium and grown at 30 °C and 200 rpm for 7 days. Each data point is the average of three biological replicates\nFull size image\nWe tested whether expression of the β-alanine pathway for 3-HP production was limiting by overexpressing additional copies of the pathway. A transgene expression cassette containing one (3HP) or one with the\naat\noverexpression (3HP-\naat\n) of the β-alanine pathway (Additional file\n1\n: Figures S4 and S5) was randomly integrated into the chromosome of transgenic strain Ap3HP6. 3-HP titer in selected transgenic strains was increased up to 3.4 g/l, about twice the concentration of the parent strain (Fig.\n1\nB). In addition to 3-HP, significant amounts of other organic acids such as aconitic acid and citric acid were produced by\nA. pseudoterreus\n[\n28\n], suggesting that it may not be an ideal acidophilic filamentous fungus for 3-HP production. Therefore,\nA. niger\n, an industrial species used for citric acid production, was examined as a host for 3-HP production.\nEvaluation of 3-HP production in\nA. niger\nThe same linearized transgene expression cassette (Additional file\n1\n: Figure S1A) used in\nA. pseudoterreus\n[\n28\n] was randomly integrated into the chromosomes of\nA. niger\n. Three transgenic\nA. niger\nstrains, An3HP5, An3HP9, and An3HP10, were selected for evaluation of 3-HP production in mRDM medium. The results in Fig.\n2\nA show that transgenic strain An3HP9 produced the highest 3-HP titer, reaching 6.8 g/l in mRDM, a 200% increase over the highest titers produced by\nA. pseudoterreus\n. Prior to further genetic engineering in the An3HP9 strain, the copy number was estimated by Southern blotting analysis. The results (are) shown in the Additional file\n1\n: Figure S6 shows that strain An3HP9 contains more than one copy of the β-alanine pathway for 3-HP production. The actual copies of insertion in An3HP9 were estimated as twelve by short-read whole genomic DNA sequencing (Table\n1\n).\nFig. 2\nA\n3-hydroxypropionic acid production (\nA\n) in the selected\nA. niger\ntransgenic strains of An3HP5, An3HP9, and An3HP10;\nB\nin the selected\nA. niger\ntransgenic strains with overexpression of pyruvate carboxylase (\npyc\n) or cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (\naat\n) in An3HP9 strain;\nC\nin the\nA. niger\ntransgenic strains with gene disruption of\nald6a\n,\nald6b\n,\nald3\n,\noahA\n, and\nuga2\nor overexpression of\nmct1\ngene in the\nA. niger\ntransgenic strain An3HP9/\npyc2\nstrain;\nD\nin the selected\nA. niger\ntransgenic strains with additional copies of β-alanine 3HP pathway.

The data are the average of three biological replicates\nFull size image\nTable 1 Copy number estimate of genes in selected strains from whole genome sequencing\nFull size table\nMulti-omics analysis of 3-HP production in\nAspergillus species\nIn both\nA. pseudoterreus\nand\nA. niger\n, transformants of the same β-alanine pathway for 3-HP production were isolated that produce a broad range of 3-HP titers. We compared transformants of both species during time-course cultivation in shake flasks in mRDM (Fig.\n3\nA). In some cases, 3-HP titer declined later in the cultivation consistent with previous observations of 3-HP degradation catalyzed by the methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase\nald6\n[\n28\n]. We therefore collected biomass and supernatant samples at day four, prior to decrease in titer, to assess the impacts of 3-HP production on metabolism by global and targeted proteomics, and intra- and extracellular metabolomics. While the range of 3-HP yields is comparable for the transformants obtained from the two\nAspergillus\nspecies, the spectrum of co-products is dissimilar. Aside from 3-HP, from the panel of metabolites quantified, only trehalose and citric acid were detected in the\nA. niger\nfermentation broth. In contrast,\nA. pseudoterreus\nproduced a wide variety of contaminating co-products that include glycerol and most of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle derived organic acids (Fig.\n3\nB). Targeted peptides designed for the heterologous enzymes in the β-alanine pathway were used to compare expression level between the species (Fig.\n3\nC) and confirmed that the pathway is expressed at a higher level in strains that produce more 3-HP.\nFig. 3\nMulti-omic analyses of 3-HP production in\nAspergillus\nspecies.\nA\n) Shake-flask cultivation of\nAspergillus\nspecies engineered to produce 3-HP.\nB\nExtracellular metabolites detected and quantified by GC–MS at day four.\nC\nProtein and intracellular metabolite levels relative to the un-engineered parent strains at day four.\nD\nTargeted peptide quantification of the heterologous pathway proteins at day four. Multiple boxes for a single protein indicate different targeted peptides. The data represent four biological replicates\nFull size image\nGlobal proteomics and metabolomics were used to assess the impact of increasing 3-HP production on metabolism. Metabolomics revealed that in both species intracellular β-alanine, 3-HP, and 4-hydroxybutyrate were significantly increased in all transformed strains. Proteomic analysis identified ALD6 as significantly upregulated in all engineered strains indicating degradation via the pathway intermediate malonate semialdehyde is a conserved aspect of 3-HP metabolism in\nAspergillus\nspecies. Proteins involved in the GABA shunt (UGA1 and UGA2) and a hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase involved in conversion of α-ketoglutarate to succinate semialdehyde and mobilization of 4-hydroxybutyrate [\n34\n] are also responsive to 3-HP production and upregulated in all engineered strains (Fig.\n3\nD).\nMost enzymes along the ideal path from glucose to 3-HP do not exhibit a consistent response to the presence of the heterologous 3-HP production pathway. However, in the highest producing\nA. niger\nstrains alanine, glutamate, and aspartate are depleted, suggesting that nitrogen pools may be stressed in this host, while in\nA. pseudoterreus\nglutamate and alanine are accumulated and both alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase are downregulated.\nAugmenting metabolic flux to precursor molecules required for 3-HP production in\nA. niger\nWhen directly compared,\nA. niger\nproduced 3-HP with fewer co-product contaminants than\nA. pseudoterreus\n. We therefore focused on the improvement of 3-HP yield from glucose in\nA. niger\n. Carbon efficient flux toward 3-HP relies on the precursor metabolites, oxaloacetate and aspartate. Omics analysis indicated that nitrogen pools that support flux through these metabolites may be strained and that the expression of pyruvate carboxylase, a critical step for carbon efficiency, may be limited in some strains. Flux toward oxaloacetate and aspartate was examined for their contribution to 3-HP production in\nA. niger\nby overexpression of pyruvate carboxylase (\npyc\n) and aspartate aminotransferase (\naat\n). cDNA of\naat\nor\npyc\nunder the control of\ntef1\n(\ntef1\np-\naat\n, Additional file\n1\n: Figure S7A), or\nmbfA\npromoter (\nmbfA\np-\npyc\n, Additional file\n1\n: Figure S7B) or the combination of\naat\nand\npyc\n(\ntef1\np-\naat\n-\npgk\nt-\npyc\n-\nmbfA\np, Additional file\n1\n: Figure S7C) was integrated into transgenic strain An3HP9. Transformants were evaluated for 3-HP production (Additional file\n1\n: Figure S8) and strains with improved titer were purified (Fig.\n2\nB). Overexpression of\naat\nincreased titer of 3-HP up to 43%, while\npyc\noverexpression increased titer by as much 93% compared to the original transgenic An3HP9 strain. This indicates that flux toward beach-head metabolites for 3-HP is limiting in An3HP9; however, no synergistic effects were observed in transgenic strains overexpressing both\naat\nand\npyc\ntogether (Additional file\n1\n: Figure S8C). The copy number of\naat\nor\npyc\nin transgenic strains An3HP9/\naat\n5 and An3HP9/\npyc\n2 (Table\n1\n) was estimated as five and eight by short-read whole genomic DNA sequencing, respectively.\nEffects of genes involved in metabolism of β-alanine pathway intermediates and 3-HP transport in\nA. niger\nRecently, we identified genes potentially involved in metabolism of 3HP pathway intermediates via multi-omics studies in\nA. pseudoterreus\n[\n28\n] and confirmed many of these as targets in\nA. niger\n(Fig.\n3\n). In this study, the\nA. niger\nhomologs of malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (jgi|Asppseute1|414254 [Ap\nald6\n] and jgi|Asppseute1|497789 [Ap\nald3\n]), succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (jgi|Asppseute1|447301 [Ap\nuga2\n]), a putative 3-HP transporter identified from\nA. pseudoterreus\n(jgi|Asppseute1|474223[Ap\nmct1\n]), and\nA. niger\noxaloacetate hydrolase (An\noahA\n) were examined for their effect on 3-HP production in the transgenic An3HP9/\npyc\n2 strain (Additional file\n1\n: Figure S7E and S9). Single gene homologs were identified for all the targets except Ap\nald6\n, where two homologs were identified in\nA. niger\n(An\nald6a\nand An\nald6b\n). The results in Fig.\n2\nC show that disruption of An\nald6a\nin strain 3HP/\npyc\n2 increased 3-HP titer by 83% to 16.5 g/l, while disruption of An\nald6b\nand An\nald3\nincreased titer by 45% and 26%, respectively suggesting that, while An\nald6a\nis likely the major malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, all three contribute to directing flux away from 3-HP. In contrast, when An\nuga2\nwas deleted, 3-HP production decreased by 37%. In this strain, growth and sugar conversion rate was decreased and the specific yield of 3-HP increased. This suggests that yield of 3-HP from sugars may be improved by limiting flux through the GABA shunt, but that deletion of the pathway entirely is overly detrimental to growth. Disruption of oxaloacetate hydrolase (An\noahA\n) increased the titer of 3-HP by 45% without impacting growth suggesting that flux toward oxalic acid, a product secreted by\nA. niger\n[\n35\n], represents a substantial loss in yield of 3-HP. A monocarboxylate transporter (An\nmct1,\nAdditional file\n1\n: Figure S7E), where the homolog in\nA. pseudoterreus\nresponds to the presence of intracellular 3-HP [\n28\n], was overexpressed, resulting in a 35% improvement in 3-HP suggesting that transport across the plasma membrane may limit 3-HP production.\nEffects of additional copies of β-alanine pathway on 3-HP production in\nA. niger\nOur initial set of\nA. niger\nand\nA. pseudoterreus\nstrains expressing various levels of the 3-HP production pathway demonstrated that a higher expression level of the β-alanine pathway genes increased the yield of 3-HP (Fig.\n3\n). To determine whether flux through the β-alanine pathway was still a limiting factor for the yield, we further increased expression by randomly integrating a new transgene expression cassette (Additional file\n1\n: Figure S10E) into the highest producing An3HP9/\npyc\n2/\nald6a\nΔ strain. Transformants with higher 3-HP titer than the parent were identified and the best performing single-spore isolate produced 20.5 g/l 3-HP, a 53% improvement over the parent strain (Fig.\n2\nD).\nShort-read whole genome sequencing was performed on selected strains at critical points in the construction lineage to estimate copy number of the randomly integrated plasmids (Table\n1\n). We found that approximately 12 copies of the β-alanine pathway were randomly integrated into the\nA. niger\nchromosomes during construction of strain An3HP9 and that seven additional copies of\npyc2\nwere integrated into the genome in strain An3HP9/\npyc2\n. In the highest producing strain (An3HP9/\npyc2\n/\nald6a\n∆/3HP-6), we confirmed deletion of\nald6a\nand found that an additional 15 copies of the β-alanine pathway were inserted into the genome bringing the total copy-number of the β-alanine pathway to approximately 27 copies.\nOptimization of culture conditions for 3HP production\nCulture conditions for citric acid by\nA. niger\nhave been optimized and are dependent on pH, as well as carbon, nitrogen, and manganese concentrations [\n31\n]. In this study, the effects of pH, manganese, and nitrogen on 3-HP production were examined with initially genetically engineered strain An3HP9 or 3HP9/\npyc\n2. The effects of citric acid production (CAP) versus mRDM medium were examined in the first\nA. niger\ntransgenic strain An3HP9 by growing them in either CAP medium or mRDM with the pH ranging from 2.0 to 3.4 since pH 2.0 is the optimal pH for CAP. 3-HP titer in CAP medium was 2.7 g/L, significantly lower than in mRDM across the pH spectrum. (Additional file\n1\n: Figure S1A). In mRDM, the spore germination rate increased with increasing pH up to 30.7% at pH 3.4 (Additional file\n1\n: Figure S1B) and coincided with increased consumption of glucose resulting in an insignificantly lower yield of 3-HP.\nTo achieve maximal 3-HP production, the effects of manganese on 3-HP production were evaluated in the transgenic strain An3HP9/\npyc\n2 strain, which contains 8 copies of\npyc\ntransgene overexpression in An3HP9 with 90% improvement in 3-HP production. When the strain was grown with 0 ~ 0.035 ppm manganese, 3-HP titer reached 5.5 g/l but when manganese was increased to 0.07, 0.7, 1.4, 14.0 ppm manganese, the 3-HP titer increased to 6.1, 6.7, 7.4, and 7.5 g/l, respectively, suggesting that the required manganese level to support 3-HP metabolism is around 1.4 ppm, about 140-fold higher than that required for citric acid production in\nA. niger\n(Fig.\n4\nA). At all manganese concentrations, the yield of 3-HP was not significantly different while the yield of biomass trended downward with increasing manganese suggesting that the increased titer is due to differences in the rate of 3-HP production. The effect of nitrogen concentration and source, in the form of (NH\n4\n)\n2\nSO\n4\nor NH\n4\nNO\n3\n, on 3-HP production in the An3HP9/\npyc\n2 strain was also examined (Fig.\n4\nB). 3-HP production increased from 2.5 to 9.7 g/l when the strain was grown in mRDM with 1.16, 2.36, or 4.72 g/l (NH\n4\n)\n2\nSO\n4\n, respectively. Increasing nitrogen increased the sugar conversion rate, but overall yield was still significantly higher at the greatest (NH\n4\n)\n2\nSO\n4\nconcentration (\np\n< 0.01). The β-alanine pathway to produce 3-HP is dependent on balanced flux through three transaminases [AAT, alanine transaminase (ALT), and BAPAT] and excess nitrogen may be required to support efficient flux through these reactions. When the strain was grown in mRDM with increasing concentrations of NH\n4\nNO\n3\n, 3-HP production decreased suggesting that the impact of NO\n3\nas a nitrogen source may be detrimental to 3-HP production. The optimal nitrogen source for batch 3-HP production in shake-flasks was 4.72 g/l of (NH\n4\n)\n2\nSO\n4\n, which corresponds to a C/N ratio of 40.\nFig. 4\nThe effects of manganese and nitrogen sources on 3-hydroxypropionic acid production in\nA. niger\ntransgenic strain An3HP/\npyc\n2 grown at 30 °C and 200 rpm for 7 days.\nA\nThe effects of manganese on 3-HP production and\nB\nthe effects of different nitrogen sources on 3-HP production. The data are the average of three biological replicates\nFull size image\nProduction of 3-HP from lignocellulosic feedstock derived sugars\nIn addition to purified glucose as a carbon source for 3-HP production, we considered sugars derived from lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock. Corn stover was subjected to dilute alkali deacetylation prior to disk refining and enzymatic hydrolysis (DDR-EH) to release glucose and xylose monomers [\n36\n,\n37\n]. We investigated conversion of sugars produced by the DDR-EH process using both An3HP9/\npyc\n2/\nald6a\nΔ and An3HP9/\npyc\n2/\nald6a\nΔ\n/\n3HP-6 strains with the highest 3-HP production titers. We initially tested 3-HP production of An3HP9/\npyc\n-2/\nald6a\nΔ strain in RDM to provide essential micro and macro-nutrients with increasing concentrations of sugars from the DDR-EH process to identify limits on conversion due to toxicity. We found that\nA. niger\nwas able to germinate and grow in up to 200 g/L total sugars from the DDR-EH process (Fig.\n5\nA) with a significantly lower yield of 3-HP at the highest sugar concentration where growth was maximized. We next looked at the impact of temperature on conversion in DDR-EH and found that 34–37 °C significantly improved both 3-HP yield and titer with a maximum of 29.4 g/L 3-HP and 0.35 C-mol 3-HP C-mol\n−1\nsugars (Fig.\n5\nB). Sugars produced using the DDR-EH process contain a wide variety of characterized and unknown metabolites. To determine whether phosphate, nitrogen, and trace elements (TE) required for growth and production are present at necessary levels in DDR-EH, we modified their concentration up and down by fivefold to represent limiting and excess concentrations (Fig.\n5\nC). We found that reducing phosphate or nitrogen concentration reduced biomass production and 3-HP titer suggesting that DDR-EH needs to be supplemented with both of these macronutrients to maximize 3-HP production. However, reduction of TE significantly improved 3-HP titer (\np\n< 0.05) while excess TE had no impact on growth or productivity suggesting that TE in DDR-EH may be present at necessary concentrations without supplementation. When excess nitrogen was supplied, 3-HP titer and yield were both significantly improved without increasing biomass suggesting that supply of precursors for the multiple transaminases of the β-alanine pathway may not be optimized and flux is aided by the presence of excess nitrogen.\nFig. 5\nOptimization of 3-HP production in RDM with sugars from DDR-EH using\nA. niger\nstrain An3HP9/\npyc\n-2/\nald6a\nΔ at 200 rpm for 7 days.\nA\nAbility of\nA. niger\nto germinate and grow in increasing DDR-EH concentrations from 100 to 250 g/L total sugar.\nB\n3-HP production in DDR-EH-100 at 30, 34, 37, and 40 °C.\nC\n3-HP production in DDR-EH-100 with limiting (0.2x) and excess (5x) concentrations of phosphate, ammonia, and trace elements.

The standard concentration of sugars was increased to 150 g/L (97.5 g/L glucose and 52.5 g/L xylose) and the temperature increased to 34 °C prior to retesting the impacts of nitrogen and trace elements (Fig.\n6\n). With the combined improvements in the standard RDM with 1 × TE and 1 × N [2.36 g/l (NH\n4\n)\n2\nSO\n4\n], 36.0 g/l 3-HP was produced, and the yield was improved to 0.48 C-mol 3-HP C-mol\n−1\nsugars. We found that reducing or completely eliminating the addition of TE from the standard RDM did not have a significant impact on growth or 3-HP production. Increasing the concentration of nitrogen tended to increase the amount of biomass produced and, in all cases, significantly decreased the yield of 3-HP.\nFig. 6\nThe impact of nitrogen and trace elements on 3-HP production in RDM with 150 g/L sugars from DDR-EH using\nA. niger\nstrain An3HP9/\npyc\n-2/\nald6a\nΔ/3HP-6 at 200 rpm and 34 °C for 7 days.

Production of monomeric 3-HP as a precursor for commodity chemical production has been proposed and developed primarily using sugars or glycerol as feedstocks, both of which have the potential to offer economic and green-house gas emission benefits compared to petroleum derived feedstocks [\n38\n]. Production of 3-HP from glycerol as a feedstock using bacterial hosts has made substantial gains toward economic viability [\n39\n,\n40\n]; however, high-yield production from sugar feedstocks has been more challenging [\n41\n] with only modest yields achieved in hosts that require expensive nutrient supplements and are limited to production of 3-hydroxypropionate near neutral pH production conditions rather than 3-hydroxypropionic acid (Table\n2\n). We therefore engineered the β-alanine pathway, which was initially alluded to in patents granted to Cargill/Novozymes [\n42\n] and later established academically in the yeast\nS. cerevisiae\n[\n27\n], in the filamentous fungal hosts\nA. pseudoterreus\nand\nA. niger\n, which have been demonstrated at scale for industrial production of organic acids at acidic pH (< 2.0) and are capable of converting mixed sugar feedstocks with minimal nutrients and without pH neutralization requirement. After several DBTL (design-build-test-learn) cycles and culture optimizations, the 3-HP production in the best\nA. niger\ntransgenic strain reached 36.0 g/l with the DDR-EH derived sugars from corn stover, which is summarized in Fig.\n7\n.\nTable 2 Nutritional requirements for production of 3-HP from sugar monomers\nFull size table\nFig. 7\nSummary of strain improvements for 3-HP production in\nA. niger\n. Yields achieved by overexpression or deletion (indicated by an ‘x’) of genes involved in 3-HP production. All yields achieved are in the 3HP-PYC background except for the β-alanine base and final pathway yields and the PYC yield\nFull size image\nIn the first design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle, the β-alanine pathway was functionally expressed in the filamentous fungus\nA. pseudoterreus\nand genes related to 3-HP degradation enzymes (Ap\nald6\n, Ap\nald3\n, Ap\nuga2\n) and monocarboxylate transport across the plasma membrane (Ap\nmct1\n) were identified via transcriptomic and proteomic analyses [\n28\n]. The lessons we learned from the first DBTL cycle in\nA. pseudoterreus\nfacilitated the transfer of the β-alanine pathway into the\nA. niger\n, citric acid production strain [\n43\n]. The same transgene expression cassette used in\nA. pseudoterreus\nwas randomly chromosomally integrated into\nA. niger\nand conferred a higher initial titer of 3-HP. Analysis of both species revealed that increased 3-HP yield correlates to copy number and expression level of the β-alanine pathway, which may explain the higher initial titers in the\nA. niger\nstrains. Production of other organic acids, such as citric acid, was below the detection limit in\nA. niger\nallowing more carbon to be routed toward 3-HP production.\nThe effects of increasing the intracellular pool of precursor metabolites such as oxaloacetate and aspartic acid on 3-HP production were first evaluated by increasing the expression of\naat1\n, or\npyc\nin the An3HP9 transgenic strain with about 30 to 90% improvements in 3-HP titer in the selected transgenic strains. Elimination of carbon fluxes competing with β-alanine pathway metabolic intermediates oxaloacetate, malonic semialdehyde, and glutamate/α-ketoglutarate was also examined in transgenic strain An3HP9/\npyc\n2. All exhibited positive effects on 3-HP production and 83% improvement in titer of 3-HP production were observed with the disruption of\nald6a\ngene. Previously we observed significant improvements in flux toward 3-HP in\nA. pseudoterreus\nafter disruption of Ap\nald6\n[\n28\n] that are consistent with results from the homolog in\nCandida albicans\n[\n44\n]. This highlights that while\nald6a\nmay be the major contributor to the pathway competition,\nA. niger\nencodes at least three enzymes capable of metabolizing the 3-HP precursor malonic semialdehyde that may need to be simultaneously disrupted to maximize yield of 3-HP.\nTo test for the possibility of reactions limiting the final steps in conversion of pyruvate to 3-HP we increased the expression level of the heterologous enzymes in the β-alanine pathway in the An3HP9/\npyc\n2/\nald6a\nΔ strain by increasing the chromosomally integrated copy-number of the pathway from 12 to 27 (Fig.\n2\nD, Table\n1\n). We also overexpressed a putative 3-HP transporter identified from our previous work [\n28\n] to test whether export may be limiting (Fig.\n2\nC). In both cases, increased expression improved the yield of 3-HP suggesting that the expression level of critical enzymes for 3-HP production is still limiting in the engineered strains and highlighting the need for novel metabolic engineering tools in\nAspergillus\nspecies capable of increasing expression level of enzymes orders of magnitude beyond what is currently possible.\nIn addition to modification of pathway enzymes in the transgenic strains, culture conditions play an essential role in directing metabolic flux toward 3-HP. The initial pH in\nA. niger\ncultures for citric acid production is 2.0 and manganese is limited to 10 ppb [\n31\n]. Here, we found that an initial pH range from 3.4 to 2 did not significantly affect 3-HP yield in the An3HP9 strain though the spore germination frequency is higher at pH 3.4. 3-HP is produced in CAP medium which supports overflow metabolism, but to a lesser extent than in the mRDM medium. Therefore, the effects of the mRDM medium on 3-HP production were further optimized by alternation of individual components. Maintenance of manganese at a very low concentration (~ 10 ppb) is required to support high-yield production of citric acid in\nA. niger\n[\n31\n,\n45\n] as well as itaconic acid in\nA. pseudoterreus\n[\n46\n]. In this study, however, we found that 100-fold higher concentrations of manganese in the culture medium support 3-HP production highlighting the difference in metabolism between production of 3-HP and the organic acids typically produced by these organisms. Tolerance, or even a requirement for higher concentrations of trace elements for 3-HP production, avoids some of typical challenges with organic acid production by\nAspergilli\nwhereby micro-nutrients leaching from metal fermentation vessels or present as contaminants in feedstock sugars negatively impact yield [\n45\n].\nAn essential component of economically viable 3-HP production is utilization of inexpensive feedstocks [\n4\n]. The 3-HP production on a DDR-EH derived sugars from corn stover was evaluated and optimized with the higher 3-HP production transgenic strains. We found that raw DDR-EH requires supplementation macro-nutrients (nitrogen and phosphate) to support growth and 3-HP production by\nA. niger\n, but that the trace elements added to RDM can be eliminated as an additive to reduce cost. The optimal temperature for 3-HP production was around 34 °C, which is consistent with optimal temperatures for enzyme activities of PAND (50 °C) of\nT. castaneum\n[\n47\n], BAPAT (35 °C) of\nB. cereus\n[\n48\n], and HPDH (37 °C) of\nE. coli\nK12-TG1 [\n49\n]. Increasing the concentration of (NH\n4\n)\n2\nSO\n4\nto the optimal level in RDM supported more growth but reduced the yield of 3-HP in DDR-EH suggesting a lower concentration of nitrogen can be used to further reduce production costs.\nEngineering efforts to produce 3-HP in fungi have demonstrated modest yields from pure glucose and xylose but typically supplement with vitamins [\n25\n,\n27\n,\n50\n,\n51\n]. Efforts have been made to produce 3-HP in the yeast\nS. cerevisiae\nin acidic conditions below the pKa of 3-HP, however yield was nearly half that achieved at pH 5 [\n27\n]. Engineering efforts to produce 3-HP from mixed sugars in bacteria (\nE. coli\nand\nC. glutamicum\n) have also been successful but typically require growth at neutral pH and supplementation with vitamins and a complex nutrient source such as yeast extract or corn-steep liquor [\n52\n,\n53\n,\n54\n,\n55\n]. Production of 3-HP using\nA. niger\nalleviates many of the economic issues presented by model yeast and bacterial hosts by eliminating the need to supplement with costly vitamins and complex nutrients and allowing for production as a free acid amenable to low-cost purification strategies (Table\n2\n).\nConclusions\nIn summary, the β-alanine pathway functions and enables high-yield 3-HP production at acidic pH from low-cost sugars derived from corn stover in the industrial filamentous fungus\nA. niger\n. Results from a DBTL cycle comparing multiple species and strains in conjunction with optimization of cultivation conditions dramatically increased the yield of 3-HP to 48% of the no-growth theoretical yield from a corn-stover feedstock. This work establishes\nAspergillus\nspecies as a platform for commercial production of renewable 3-HP as a precursor for a variety of fossil-derived chemicals including 1,3-propanediol, acrylic acid, methyl acrylate, acrylamide, and acrylonitrile. Future work focused on stacking of genetic improvements identified herein a single transgenic strain and scale-up will de-risk commercial production of renewable 3-HP and support the transition of commodity-scale chemical synthesis to lower green-house gas emitting processes.\nMethods\nStrains and media\nThe\nEscherichia coli\nstrain Top10 was used for routine plasmid DNA preparation.\nA. pseudoterreus\n(ATCC 32359) and\nA. niger\n(ATCC 11414) from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) were grown on complete medium (CM) or potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates at 30 °C for culture maintenance and spore preparation. About 1 × 10\n4\nto 1 × 10\n5\nspores were inoculated on CM agar (petri dish) plates and incubated for four days at 30 °C. Spores were harvested by washing with 5–10 ml sterile 0.4% Tween 80 (polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate) and pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 g for 5 min. The spores were re-suspended in sterile 0.4% Tween 80 and enumerated with a hemocytometer. Aliquots of the resulting spore suspension (about 10\n8\n~ 10\n9\nspores/ml) were used to inoculate different agar-plates or liquid cultures. The preparation of PDA, CM, and minimal medium (MM) followed the description of Bennett and Lasure [\n56\n]. All strains used in this study are shown in Table\n3\n.\nTable 3 Parent and transgenic strains of\nA. pseudoterreus\nand\nA. niger\nused in this study\nFull size table\nPreparation of transgene expression constructs for gene overexpression or gene disruption in\nA. pseudoterreus\nand\nA. niger\nIn our previous study, the β-alanine pathway transgene expression cassette with pyrithiamine resistance gene (\nptrA\n) of\nAspergillus oryzae\nas a selection marker was described previously [\n28\n]. In this study, all transgene expression cassettes were prepared with Gibson assembly master mix (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) and the DNA fragments were isolated by PCR with Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA 02451, USA). Different transgene expression cassettes, related intermediate plasmids, or selection marker gene cassettes prepared for this study are thoroughly described in the section of “Detailed description of transgene vector construction for selected gene overexpression or disruption in\nAspergillus pseudoterreus\nor\nAspergillus niger\n” in Additional file\n1\n.\nCulture methods\nPyrex 125 ml or 250 ml glass Erlenmeyer flasks were prepared by filling with 5% Contrad 70 (Decon Labs, Inc., King of Prussia, PA, USA) and soaked overnight to remove any potential residues on the inside surface of flasks prior to general dishwashing. Silicon sponge closures were used for all flask cultures. The biomass of transgenic clones and parent strain for genomic DNA isolation were prepared from 2 mL stationary CM cultures with proper antibiotics and grown in 13 × 100 mm glass culture-tubes for 24–36 h at 30 °C. The biomass formed on the surface of the liquid culture medium was collected, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and dried in the VirTis benchtop manifold freeze dryer (SP Scientific, Gardiner, NY, USA). For 3-HP production, 35 ml of citric acid production (CAP) medium was prepared by the following previous descriptions [\n31\n]. Production medium B (RDM) [\n33\n] or modified production medium B (mRDM) [\n28\n,\n33\n] that contains 20 × TE (trace elements: 4 mg/l CuSO\n4\n.5H\n2\nO; 110 mg/l FeSO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO; 14 mg/l MnCl\n2\n.4H\n2\nO; and 26 mg/l ZnSO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO) was also used. The fermented sugars liberated from corn stover by deacetylated and disk-refined process (DDR), in which the biomass was deacetylated with dilute alkaline at low temperature first, then mechanically refined in an industrial size disk refiner, and finally enzymatically hydrolyzed [DDR-EH; Batch 1–19-05, 20190829, [\n57\n]], were obtained from the Pilot Plant at National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Golden, CO, USA).\nChemical-mediated protoplast transformation of\nA. niger\nThe protoplast preparation and chemical-mediated transformation followed the method described by Dai et al. [\n58\n] for\nA. niger\n. Briefly, the 14.4 kb plasmid DNA of the β-alanine pathway transgene expression construct was linearized by restriction enzyme\nEco\nRV and concentrated down to about 1 µg/µl with Microcon-30 kDa centrifugal filter unit (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA). Ten microliters of the linearized plasmid DNA were used for protoplast transformation in\nA. niger\n. For transgene overexpression of\nA. niger aat1\n,\npyc\n, the\naat1\n-\npyc\n, or\nmct1\ngene in\nA. niger\n, about 3–5 µg of linearized plasmid DNAs by proper restriction enzymes were used for protoplast transformation. For the gene deletion construct of\nald6a\n,\nald6b\n,\noah1\n, or\nuga2\ngene homolog, about 1 µg of linearized plasmid DNAs by restriction enzyme\nPme\nI was used for protoplast transformation in\nA. niger\n. Usually, about 5 to 12 transformed clones were picked randomly for the evaluation of 3-HP production and the effects of selected genes on 3-HP production. The chemical-mediated protoplast transformation of\nA. pseudoterreus\nwas mainly followed the previous description [\n59\n].\nTotal genomic DNA isolation for PCR, Southern blotting analysis, and short-read whole genomic DNA sequencing\nTotal genomic DNA was isolated from\nA. niger\nor\nA. pseudoterreus\ncells using a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) extraction method with some modifications. Briefly, 50–100 mg of lyophilized biomass and two 3.5 mm diameter glass beads were transferred into a 2 mL polypropylene micro-vial, where biomass was pulverized into fine power with a Mini-Beadbeater-8 (Bio Spec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA) for 50 s. The disrupted cells in microcentrifuge tubes were re-suspended with 800–900 µl of CTAB solution and incubated at 60 °C for 30 ~ 45 min and inverted occasionally. The genomic DNA in the supernatant of the cell extracts was extracted with 300 µl of phenol/chloroform solution and precipitated with 1 volume of 2-propanol. The genomic DNA was resuspended with 200 µl of 50TE (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH8.0 and 10 mM EDTA, pH8.0) and 25 µg of RNase and incubated for 30 ~ 45 min at 50 °C. After RNase treatment, the genomic DNA was extracted twice with 125 µl of phenol/chloroform solution and once with chloroform. The genomic DNA in the supernatants was precipitated with 1 M NaCl and 2 volume of 95% ethanol for 15 min at room temperature and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 8 min. Finally, the genomic DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and was resuspended in 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) buffer at 50 °C for 15–20 min and the concentration was determined with a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Fifty to seventy ng of total genomic DNA were used for PCR analyses.\nFor Southern blotting analyses of heterologous expression of β-alanine pathway in either\nA. niger\nor\nA. pseudoterreus\n, 1 µg of total genomics DNA was digested with the restriction endonuclease\nBam\nHI,\nEco\nRV, or\nHin\ndIII. The genomic DNA fragments were separated in 1% agarose gel electrophoretically and transferred onto the Hybond-N\n+\nnylon membrane (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) with alkaline capillary transfer method. The 1.0 kb 3’-end of genomic DNA fragments of\nA. pseudoterreus cad1\ngene was used for the preparation of the biotin-labeled probe. The genomic DNA in the Hybond-N\n+\nnylon membrane was hybridized with the biotin-labeled probe overnight at 60 °C in the Problot Hybridization Oven (Labnet International, Edison, NJ, USA). The genomic DNA on the hybridized membrane was visualized with North2South chemiluminescent detection kit (Pierce Protein Research Products, Rockford, IL, USA) in Analytikjena UVP ChemStudio (Analytik Jena US, Upland, CA, USA).\nThe short-read whole genomic DNA sequencing was carried out by Azenta Life Sciences (South Plainfield, NJ, USA). The integration copy number was estimated by fold-increase of reads mapped to the expression construct versus background single copy regions of the genome. The sequenced short-reads were mapped to the reference genome sequence of\nA. niger\nATCC 1015 (\nhttps://mycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/Aspni7/Aspni7.home.html\n) augmented with the overexpressed gene sequence using BWA-MEM [\n60\n]. The mapped reads were sorted using SAMtools [\n61\n] and duplicate reads were marked using Picard Toolkit (\nhttps://github.com/broadinstitute/picard#citing\n) to produce BAM files for copy number estimation. The copy numbers of β-alanine pathway genes and engineered native genes were estimated using CNVnator [\n62\n]. The mapped reads were counted using bin sizes of 100, 200, and 1,000 bp, and the read depth signal was partitioned into segments for each bin size. The average and standard deviation of read depth signal were evaluated for bin sizes of 100 and 200 bp, and copy number genotype was estimated based on the normalized read depth using the bin size of 100 bp.\nMetabolites analysis by HPLC\nThe extracellular metabolites were quantified by HPLC. Twenty-five microliters of the samples filtered with 0.2 µm syringe filters were analyzed for 45 min using an Aminex HPX-87H ion exclusion column with a 1 mM H\n2\nSO\n4\nflow of 0.6 ml/ml. The temperature of the column was 60 °C. The refractive index at 45 °C and the UV absorption at 210 nm were measured.\nSample preparation for metabolomics and proteomics analyses\nBriefly, the culture supernatants or biomass (cell pellet) for\nA. niger\nor\nA. pseudoterreus\nwere harvested at day 4. For quantification of extracellular metabolites diluted spent medium samples (by a 1/8 factor) were dried, prepared, and analyzed as described previously [\n28\n]. The cell pellets were extracted using the MPLex protocol [\n63\n] and extracts were analyzed using GC–MS as explained previously in detail [\n64\n]. The protein interlayer pellet was digested and prepared for global proteomics analysis and targeted proteomics analysis, the latter using heavy labeled peptides. Instrument acquisition and data analysis were done as described in a previous publication [\n28\n].

As the throughput of sequencing experiments increases, the preparation of conventional multiplexed libraries becomes more labor intensive. Conventional library preparation typically requires quality control (QC) testing for individual libraries such as amplification success evaluation and quantification, none of which occur until the end of the library preparation process.\nResults\nIn this study, we address the need for a more streamlined high-throughput NGS workflow by tethering real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) to conventional workflows to save time and implement single tube and single reagent QC. We modified two distinct library preparation workflows by replacing PCR and quantification with qPCR using SYBR Green I. qPCR enabled individual library quantification for pooling in a single tube without the need for additional reagents. Additionally, a melting curve analysis was implemented as an intermediate QC test to confirm successful amplification. Sequencing analysis showed comparable percent reads for each indexed library, demonstrating that pooling calculations based on qPCR allow for an even representation of sequencing reads. To aid the modified workflow, a software toolkit was developed and used to generate pooling instructions and analyze qPCR and melting curve data.\nConclusions\nWe successfully applied fluorescent amplification for next generation sequencing (FA-NGS) library preparation to both plasmids and bacterial genomes. As a result of using qPCR for quantification and proceeding directly to library pooling, the modified library preparation workflow has fewer overall steps. Therefore, we speculate that the FA-NGS workflow has less risk of user error. The melting curve analysis provides the necessary QC test to identify and troubleshoot library failures prior to sequencing. While this study demonstrates the value of FA-NGS for plasmid or gDNA libraries, we speculate that its versatility could lead to successful application across other library types.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nRapid and Easy Protocol for Quantification of Next-Generation Sequencing Libraries\nChapter\n© 2018\nComparison of DNA Quantification Methods for Next Generation Sequencing\nArticle\nOpen access\n06 April 2016\nMultiplex Analyses Using Real-Time Quantitative PCR\nChapter\n© 2017\nExplore related subjects\nDiscover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\nDNA sequencing\nFlow cytometry\nFluorescence in situ hybridization\nNext-generation sequencing\nSequencing\nWhole genome amplification\nUse our pre-submission checklist\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\nBackground\nNext generation sequencing (NGS) is becoming a predominant tool in answering a broad range of biological questions. Its popularity can be attributed to its cost-effectiveness, its broad utility, and its multiplexing capabilities, which can be used to sequence hundreds, if not thousands, of individual libraries simultaneously [\n1\n]. Because library preparation is step-intensive and cumbersome, multiplexing comes with a series of technical challenges [\n2\n]. Most notably, after DNA purification, each individual library requires individual quality controls (QC) to determine if the library amplified and the concentration after amplification. The concentration of each library is then used to determine the relative quantities of DNA so that they can be pooled in equal amounts. Accurate quantification of NGS libraries is important to ensure evenness of library pooling before sequencing. Current strategies available for quantifying NGS libraries after amplification and purification include Quant-iT dsDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), real-time qPCR-based library quantification methods like the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Roche, Pleasanton, CA) [\n3\n], and digital PCR [\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n]. Each of the aforementioned quantification methods have been validated for NGS library preparation, but are notably laborious when applying them to high-throughput workflows. Modifications to the standard library preparation workflow must be considered to make multiplexing a more viable option for researchers. Our goal was to establish a modified library preparation workflow that eases multiplexing by limiting the number of steps required per individual library. We accomplished this by bridging amplification and QC steps to bypass individual DNA purification using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). We call this library preparation workflow modification fluorescent amplification for NGS (FA-NGS).\nA wide range of applications rely on qPCR, including genotyping analysis, medical diagnostics, gene expression profiling [\n7\n], phytopathogen identification [\n8\n], forensic studies [\n9\n], and validation of DNA microarrays [\n10\n]. In the context of NGS, qPCR has been used primarily for the quantification of NGS libraries, which is used to pool purified libraries in equal amounts, a crucial step in preventing poor quality sequencing data [\n11\n]. As opposed to employing quantification after DNA amplification and purification of individual libraries, we hypothesized that we could replace these two steps with a single qPCR step using SYBR Green I.\nIn addition to reducing the number of steps in the NGS library preparation workflow, qPCR with SYBR green I added supplementary benefits to the modified NGS workflow. qPCR is a widely used technique for nucleic acid detection and quantification that employs polymerases together with intercalating fluorescent dyes or optionally fluorescently labeled sequence-specific probes. The development of inhibitor-tolerant fusion polymerases such as the Pfu-Sso7d polymerase [\n12\n,\n13\n], which is used with SYBR green I allows for flexibility in reaction conditions, including nucleic acid sample input types with NGS library preparation reagents. Other advantages include a wide dynamic range (up to 8 logs), and high sensitivity even with low volumes or low input quantities. Finally, because the data is collected in a closed-tube system, there is reduced risk for sample contamination [\n14\n].\nA limitation of using PCR dyes such as SYBR is a lack of binding specificity. These nonspecific dyes, unlike probe-based assays, intercalate with any dsDNA including primer-dimer, which can lead to false positives. However, since the melting temperature of primer dimer is typically much lower than the amplicons of interest, melting curve analysis (MCA) at the end of qPCR enables easy detection of amplicon over primer dimers. We hypothesized that we could use MCA, enabled by qPCR, to determine if individual libraries were properly amplified without any additional reagents or costs.\nTo evaluate whether a combination of qPCR and MCA could be applied to NGS library construction, we modified two distinct library workflows. We first tested FA-NGS with Illumina’s Nextera XT (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The standard workflow uses enzymatic fragmentation with transposases followed by conventional PCR amplification with indexed primers, purification, and quantification. Our workflow modifications included replacing PCR and the final quantification with low volume qPCR and SYBR Green I, and adding MCA. We also adopted additional modifications for the Nextera workflow, which have been previously shown to have utility for multiplexing NGS libraries such as automation using Echo acoustic liquid handling and reduction in reaction volumes [\n15\n,\n16\n,\n17\n]. We next evaluated FA-NGS with adapter ligation-based library construction kit using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA library preparation kit. The standard workflow includes DNA shearing, a multi-step process for adapter ligation, intermediate purification and quantification, and PCR with indexed primers followed by a final purification and quantification. As with the first NGS library workflow, our modifications included replacing PCR and the final quantification with low volume qPCR and SYBR Green I, and adding MCA.\nThe libraries from both modified workflows utilizing FA-NGS (Fig.\n1\n, Additional file\n1\n: Fig. S1) were sequenced in this study. These modifications reduced the hands-on time to construct the library, the PCR reaction volume, and the overall risk of sample contamination [\n14\n]. We found that by replacing conventional PCR with qPCR in NGS library preparation, we were able to successfully use quantified measurements of fluorescence as a proxy for relative concentration to pool 96 individual libraries (Fig.\n1\n, Additional file\n1\n: Fig. S1). Because we replaced PCR with qPCR, we were also able to perform MCA as an intermediate QC to confirm library amplification. This was done with a simple procedure and did not incur additional reagent cost.\nFig. 1\nFA-NGS Workflow\n: Following library preparation method of choice, amplification is applied with SYBR green mastermix, including polymerase (pink clouds), intercalating dye (green rectangles), and index primers (yellow, blue, purple rectangles). The fluorescence is monitored during library amplification. Melting curve analysis is then applied to an aliquot of the library to determine amplification success. If libraries pass the melting curve analysis QC, end RFU measurements are used to pool the amplified libraries in equal quantities. Libraries that fail melting curve analysis QC are omitted from subsequent steps. The pooled library is then purified and ready for NGS\nFull size image\nResults\nWe chose to apply FA-NGS to two commonly used methods for preparing libraries. We used Nextera-based library preparations of plasmid DNA and adapter ligation-based library preparations of purified genomic DNA (gDNA). Using an input titration assay, we determined that the concentration of input adapter-ligated (AL) gDNA or plasmid could be tracked by FA-NGS with NGS primers (Fig.\n2\n, Additional file\n2\n: Fig. S2 and Additional file\n3\n: Fig. S3). We observed that we could apply Nextera tagmentation and FA-NGS to plasmids with starting amounts as low as 1.5 pg per 7.5 μL reaction. We also found that the detection limit of FA-NGS above a 1000 end relative fluorescence unit (RFU) threshold for AL libraries was about 62.5 pg per 7.5 μL reaction (Fig.\n2\na). For gDNA samples, the end RFU values scaled with the 2-fold dilution factor of the starting amount of the input (Fig.\n2\nb). This indicated that the end RFU values could be used to estimate the transfer volumes required to generate a library of approximately equal concentrations of each indexed sample. MCA of the AL gDNA input showed that even samples with input below 62.5 pg still have amplified DNA, as observed by a high melting temperature peak (Fig.\n2\nc, Additional file\n4\n: Fig. S4B). For input values below 8 pg, no such high temperature peak was observed.\nFig. 2\nInput titration of AL-DNA monitored with FA-NGS:\nDNA diluted 2-fold starting at 1000 pg per reaction was amplified with SYBR green in duplicate and monitored with continuous fluorescence (\na\n), end-fluorescence (\nb\n), and melting curve analysis (\nc\n)\nFull size image\nCombinations of dual index primers were used to uniquely index 96 samples. The plasmid library consisted of 4 plasmids (Table\n1\n) with 24 replicates for each. The gDNA library was prepared with gDNA isolated from the same organism,\nPseudomonas stutzeri\nRCH2, with 24 replicates of 4 starting amounts. The libraries were amplified and measured with continuous fluorescence. End RFU values were used as a proxy for relative concentration of each individual library. As expected, wells with similar starting amounts yielded similar end RFU values (Fig.\n3\nb, Additional file\n4\n: Fig. S4).\nTable 1\nPlasmids used in Nextera library preparation.\nAll plasmids used are available through the public instance of the ABF registry [\n18\n].

Heatmaps of end RFU values and the corresponding calculated transfer volume of each well, 4 unique plasmids per quadrant of Nextera library prepared plasmids (\nb\n), 4 two-fold dilutions starting at 500 pg per quadrant of AL library prepared gDNA (\nc\n)\nFull size image\nMCA (Additional file\n5\n: Fig. S5 and Additional file\n6\n: Fig. S6) was applied to assess the overall quality of each indexed sample. This enabled us to predict individual library failure prior to sequencing. As expected, a late melting peak was observed for wells with the appropriate template DNA. Samples without DNA template or with degraded DNA template were expected to have a low temperature peak, an indication of primer dimer and lack of library amplification (Fig.\n2\nc, Additional file\n3\n: Fig. S3).\nTo determine whether the end RFU values were a reasonable measurement of the final concentration of DNA after amplification, we sequenced the two libraries consisting of 96 combinations of dual indices with the Illumina MiSeq Reagent Nano kit. We observed that the percent of reads of each sample was comparable in both Nextera and AL libraries (Fig.\n4\n). Both the Nextera and AL libraries yielded similar distribution of percent reads with a\np\n-value of 1 (Additional file\n7\n: Fig. S7). While each sample is not pooled at exactly 1.04% of the reads (expectation for optimal pooling from 96 samples), a majority of the samples from each library do fall below a 50% difference from optimal pooling range (Additional file\n8\n: Fig. S8). Sequencing quality value scores for the PhiX Control Library and for the FA-NGS libraries were above the specification provided by Illumina of at least 80% Q30 [\n22\n] (Additional file\n9\n: Fig. S9).\nFig. 4\nLibrary pooling yields near even distribution of percent of the total reads:\nOptimal pooling is the expectation (1.04) of the percent reads if all 96 libraries pooled evenly. 4 unique plasmids of Nextera library prepared plasmids (\na\n), 4 two-fold dilutions starting at 500 pg of AL library prepared gDNA (\nb\n). The bars are colored by the end RFU values of the qPCR, blue if the RFU was greater than 1000, yellow if the RFU was between 700 and 1000, and red if the RFU was less than 700. For gDNA library (\nb\n), samples below RFU 700 were likely to be underpooled because they were out of the linear range of the qPCR. This trend was not observed with the plasmid library (\na\n)\nFull size image\nDiscussion\nIn this report, we provide the validation of time-saving modifications to two common workflows for NGS library preparation. By implementing FA-NGS, we show that we can monitor amplification of each sample within an NGS library, perform quantification during qPCR to determine library normalization ratios for sequencing, and simultaneously perform a simple QC to confirm the amplified DNA template is present.\nFA-NGS allows for accurate pooling directly after PCR, reducing the risk of user error. Typical NGS library preparation requires individual library purification prior to QC and pooling (Additional file\n1\n: Fig. S1), which could lead to sample mix up or loss of library. Alternatively, unpurified and unquantified libraries could be pooled in equivolume amounts, however there would be no indication that the library amplified (increasing the potential for pooling primer dimer which would have deleterious effects during sequencing [\n23\n]) or that the samples varied in concentration. To avoid the latter issue, many PCR cycles (> 20 cycles) could be applied to fully saturate the reactions, however, this introduces the caveat of increased PCR bias, which can impact downstream interpretation of sequencing results. FA-NGS resolves these problems with a single step of amplification and quantification.\nMCA enables users to perform individual library QC testing without DNA purification. Many workflows, especially Nextera-based library preparations lack QC tests until the final step of the protocol. When used on small aliquots of the amplified libraries, MCA confirms if an amplified library product is present. In applying FA-NGS, we suggest removing wells containing samples without amplified library, as determined by MCA, from the pooling calculations. Samples without amplified library may contain primer dimer, which if not removed in a final size selection can impact sequencing run quality and cause over clustering since smaller DNA fragments cluster more efficiently [\n24\n]. In accordance with our goal to make a user-friendly NGS library preparation workflow for multiplexed libraries, MCA adds an important QC step without additional costs or reagents.\nThe modified NGS workflow strategies described here are most beneficial for high-throughput NGS library applications, due to their compatibility with automation systems such as the Labcyte Echo. In order to make this modified workflow accessible to researchers with high-throughput NGS workflows, we made a FA-NGS software tool available on GitHub (see availability of data and materials) that can be used for set-up, analysis, and pooling of FA-NGS libraries. The “set-up tool” outputs a. CSV file for primer transfer on the Echo acoustic liquid dispensing system. The “analysis tools” enable rapid determination of sample failure from end RFU and melting curve measurements. These tools output heatmaps of the end-fluorescent values and small multiple MCA plots in the plate layout of the user’s choice. The “pooling calculator” outputs a. CSV file, compatible with the Echo acoustic liquid dispensing system, for pooling libraries based on end RFU values.\nA common goal in quantifying individual samples within a pooled library is to ensure that one given sample is not overrepresented as compared to another. Because of the potential variation in DNA shearing or fragmentation size distributions from NGS library preparation, it may be recommended to both measure the library concentrations and perform individual library size analysis to enable pooling in equimolar amounts. However, individual library size analysis for high-throughput sequencing applications can be laborious and costly. We demonstrate using relative fluorescence from qPCR to normalize library concentrations, without applying individual sizing analysis, that the distribution of sequencing reads (Fig.\n4\n, Additional file\n7\n: Fig. S7 and Additional file\n8\n: Fig. S8) from using the FA-NGS library quantification strategy is sufficient to give comparable representation of 96 libraries.\nTo further validate the FA-NGS workflow, we performed sequencing quality assessment and included the Illumina PhiX Library Control for comparison. All libraries surpassed the recommended quality value score (Additional file\n9\n: Fig. S9), per Illumina’s specification of the percentage of bases at or above Q30, indicating that the FA-NGS workflow successfully generated high quality sequencing reads.\nWhile implementing FA-NGS has many benefits, the apparent pitfalls must be noted. We observed that samples in the gDNA library with end RFU values below 700 RFU were under-pooled (Figs.\n3\nb and\n4\nb). Because these samples were out of the fluorescence linear range of the qPCR, it is likely that the end-fluorescent values for these samples could not be used as a precise proxy for the relative DNA concentration and were therefore transferred at a volume that overestimated the relative concentration. We did not observe this trend with the plasmid library. We speculate that variation in percent reads for plasmid libraries could be an effect of amplifying beyond the exponential phase to the plateau phase of qPCR, such that the end-fluorescent values used for pooling were less precise (Additional file\n10\n: Fig. S10). For standard library preparation workflows that use conventional PCR, there could be a comparable limitation during the final library quantification step, depending on the fluorescence linear range of the DNA quantification assay [\n25\n,\n26\n]. For high-throughput applications employing FA-NGS, it may actually be preferable to allow amplification to the plateau phase, since initial sample concentrations or sample types may vary and the additional qPCR cycles help ensure all samples are sufficiently amplified.\nThe libraries in this report were sequence validated with Illumina Miseq Nano kits as proof of principle for our modified library workflow. Although the Nano kits give relatively low read counts compared to other Illumina sequencing kits, they generated more than sufficient coverage for the 96 plasmids (Additional file\n11\n: Table S1). However, for deep sequencing such as for bacterial genomes, larger MiSeq, HiSeq, or NovaSeq kits are generally recommended.\nIn this study, our modified workflow was successfully applied towards sequencing of full plasmids and bacterial genomes. These streamlined library preparations improve QC testing capability while reducing the total number of steps required to generate libraries.\nConclusions\nHere we present a useful modification to conventional NGS library preparation workflows, FA-NGS, which was successfully incorporated into Illumina Nextera XT and NEBNext Ultra II DNA library preparation. We demonstrate the FA-NGS workflow ease of use with fewer overall steps than conventional library workflows, as well as an MCA QC test to confirm successful library construction before sequencing. An open source FA-NGS software tool is available to assist in implementing the workflow (see availability of data and materials). We expect that the application of FA-NGS will greatly benefit the production of any NGS library type which is amplified by PCR.\nMethods\nPlasmid DNA\nPlasmid DNA was extracted from\nE. coli\nusing the PureYield Plasmid Miniprep System (Promega, Madison, WI).\nE. coli\ncultures were grown overnight in LB medium supplemented with the appropriate resistance markers. DNA was quantified by the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Each plasmid was diluted to 0.1 ng/μl for use in library construction. Plasmids are listed in Table\n1\n. All plasmids used are available through the public instance of the ABF registry [\n18\n]. See the availability of data and materials section for additional information.\nEnzymatic fragmentation and adapter ligation of plasmids\nPlasmids were fragmented and ligated to partial Illumina adapters sequences in a single step using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Reactions were set up as described previously [\n27\n]. Using the Labcyte Echo 550 acoustic liquid dispensing system (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA), the Nextera tagmentation reaction volume was reduced to 1 μL total. Samples were incubated at 55 °C for 5 min for fragmentation and ligation, then at 70 °C for 15 min for heat inactivation of transposase enzymes. This reaction was immediately followed by qPCR.\nNextera library amplification of using real-time qPCR\nPairwise 8-nucleotide barcodes and the remainder of the Illumina adapter sequences were added using primers from the Nextera XT Index Kit v2. Primers were transferred using the Echo 550. Real-time qPCR and concurrent amplification and relative quantification of the library was facilitated on the CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The Biomek Nx S8 was used to add SYBR Green and water. Reaction volumes were 7.5 μL total, with 0.25 μL each of the indexed Nextera primers, 3.75 μL of SYBR Green, 2.25 μL water, and 1 μL of the previous reaction. Cycling parameters were 72 °C for 3 min, 98 °C for 30 s, followed by 20 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 63 °C and 3 min at 72 °C. The end RFU values were determined with CFX Manager software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for all libraries.\nShearing and adapter-ligation of genomic DNA\nPseudomonas stutzeri\nRCH2 was grown overnight in 5 mL UGA media [\n20\n]. UGA media contained 4.7 mM ammonium chloride, 1.3 mM potassium chloride, 2 mM magnesium sulfate, 0.1 mM calcium chloride, 0.3 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 20 mM sodium lactate, and 25 mM MOPS. Vitamins and minerals were added as described by Widdel and Bak [\n28\n]. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Wizard genomic kit (Promega, Madison, WI) per the manufacturer’s protocols. The resulting genomic DNA was diluted to 30 ng/μL and sheared with Covaris microTubes (Covaris, Woburn, MA) using the standard protocol for shearing DNA to 200 base pairs. Following shearing, 1 μg of sheared genomic DNA was ligated to adapters using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA library preparation kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions without size selection and up until the final PCR. Size distribution of the adapter ligated DNA was verified on the Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). It was then quantified with NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, DE).\nAdapter-ligation gDNA library amplification using real-time qPCR\n7.5 μL PCR reactions were set up in a 384-well PCR plate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with 3.75 μL SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), 0.15 μL 50 μM i5 primer, 0.15 μL 50 μM i7 primer (Additional file\n12\n: Table S2), and 3.45 μL (500, 250, 125 and 62.5 pg) adapter ligated DNA diluted in 1X Phosphate Buffer Saline adapter ligated DNA diluted in 1X Phosphate Buffer Saline. Cycling parameters were 72 °C for 3 min, 98 °C for 30 s, followed by 15 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 65 °C and 1 min 45 s at 72 °C. The end RFU values were determined with CFX Manager software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for all libraries.\nSet-up for melting curve and pooling for adapter-ligated libraries and Nextera libraries\nThe PCRs were diluted with 2.5 μL water with the Biomek FX (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). 7 μL of the diluted PCRs were transferred to low dead volume (LDV) plates (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA) compatible with the Labcyte Echo 550 (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA) leaving 3 μL of diluted PCR behind. The PCR plate was transferred to the CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for MCA. The LDV plate was stored at − 20 °C until library pooling.\nMelting curve analysis adapter-ligated DNA and Nextera libraries\nThe PCR plates were incubated in the CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for MCA, gradually ramping from 50 °C to 95 °C using increments of 0.5 °C, with 5 s at each temperature as fluorescence was monitored by CFX Manager software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).\nLibrary pooling calculation adapter-ligated DNA and Nextera libraries\nThe transfer volume of each PCR reaction was calculated with the end RFU values determined with CFX Manager Software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). To calculate the transfer volume of a given well, the minimum fluorescence volume was multiplied by the maximum allowable transfer volume and was then divided by the actual fluorescence value of that well.\nLibrary pooling\nThe LDV plate containing the diluted libraries was thawed to room temperature for library pooling. Each well was transferred to a 384-well PCR plate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with the Echo 550 (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA) using the transfer volumes calculated from the end RFU values. To avoid drip-back from the destination plate, the maximum volume transferred to each well in the 384-well PCR plate was 15 μL. The contents of each transfer well in the destination plate were then pooled together in a 1.7 mL tube (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Following pooling, the library was cleaned up with AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Library quality and size distribution was visualized on the Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), and concentration was measured with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).\nIllumina sequencing\nThe Nextera and adapter-ligated libraries were sequenced with the MiSeq Reagent Nano kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA), following Illumina’s standard protocol. PhiX Control Library (v3) (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was included with the libraries as an internal sequencing control. The Nextera library and adapter-ligated libraries ran for two rounds of 150 or 100 cycles, respectively.\nIllumina sequencing analysis\nAnalysis of both sequencing runs was accomplished using embedded MiSeq Reporter (MSR) software (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The reads were aligned to the appropriate reference sequences with BWA-MEM [\n29\n]. Sequencing and alignment metrics were generated via MSR. For quality assessment of sequencing reads, BBTools Reformat [\n30\n] was used to generate quality value scores for individual libraries and the PhiX Control Library.\nFA-NGS software tool\nThe FA-NGS software tool was written in python using pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.pyplot libraries. The code is divided into four classes: set-up, plates, analysis, and pooling calculator. Set-up is used to output a CSV file with Labcyte echo instrument instructions for how to set up the multiplexed PCR plates with single or dual indexed primers. The input is an excel file with plate layouts for source plate, reverse primer destinations, and forward primer destinations. The plates class is used to customize plate setups. This software tool can use 96 well plates, 384 well plates, quadrants of a 384 well plate, and is suitable for some customizable setups. Analysis is used to read and visualize end RFU measurements and MCA directly from the Bio-Rad CFX instrument output files. The pooling calculator reads the end RFU measurements output file to determine pooling quantities. The calculator outputs instructions for pooling with Labcyte Echo instruments as well as a visualization of transfer volumes per well. The FA-NGS software tool was written in python and is available for download. See the availability of data and materials section for additional information.\nAvailability of data and materials\nThe FA-NGS software tool was written in python and is available for download at:\nhttps://github.com/AgileBioFoundry/FA-NGS\n.

Deconstruction of biomass to sugars and lignin yields a wide variety of low molecular weight carbon substrates that need to be funneled to product.\nPseudomonas putida\nKT2440 has emerged as a potential platform for bioconversion of lignin and the other components of plant biomass. However,\nP. putida\nis unable to natively utilize several of the common sugars in hydrolysate streams, including galactose.\nResults\nIn this work, we integrated a De Ley–Doudoroff catabolic pathway for galactose catabolism into the chromosome of\nP. putida\nKT2440, using genes from several different organisms. We found that the galactonate catabolic pathway alone (DgoKAD) supported slow growth of\nP. putida\non galactose. Further integration of genes to convert galactose to galactonate and to optimize the transporter expression level resulted in a growth rate of 0.371 h\n−1\n. Additionally, the best-performing strain was demonstrated to co-utilize galactose with glucose.\nConclusions\nWe have engineered\nP. putida\nto catabolize galactose, which will allow future engineered strains to convert more plant biomass carbon to products of interest. Further, by demonstrating co-utilization of glucose and galactose, continuous bioconversion processes for mixed sugar streams are now possible.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nSystems biology of electrogenic\nPseudomonas putida\n- multi-omics insights and metabolic engineering for enhanced 2-ketogluconate production\nArticle\nOpen access\n11 September 2024\nValorization of\nGelidium amansii\nfor dual production of D-galactonic acid and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid by chemo-biological approach\nArticle\nOpen access\n14 May 2020\nLarge-scale kinetic metabolic models of\nPseudomonas putida\nKT2440 for consistent design of metabolic engineering strategies\nArticle\nOpen access\n28 February 2020\nExplore related subjects\nDiscover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\nBiocatalysis\nBiosynthesis\nBiofuels\nMetabolic Engineering\nSugar Phosphate\nBiochemical Engineering\nUse our pre-submission checklist\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\nBackground\nThe vast majority of global fuels and platform chemicals are produced from petroleum. However, petroleum is a finite resource, so synthesizing platform chemicals from renewable feedstocks is needed for a sustainable future. Biological valorization of sugars and lignin from plant-based biomass to commodity chemicals is a potential route to renewable and sustainable alternatives. Although different feedstocks and pretreatment processes yield different available substrates for microbial conversion, several sugars are regularly detected in hydrolysate streams [\n1\n,\n2\n]. While glucose is typically the most abundant, xylose, galactose, mannose, and arabinose are all present as well at different concentrations. In order to effectively convert these sugars to product, an ideal organism would at a minimum require high tolerance to inhibitors and rapid sugar catabolism.\nPseudomonas putida\nKT2440 is emerging as a new favorite synthetic biology chassis for biocatalysis of deconstructed biomass [\n3\n].\nP. putida\nKT2440 has a wide range of genetic tools available [\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n], a well-characterized metabolism well suited for redox-intensive transformations [\n8\n,\n9\n,\n10\n,\n11\n], demonstrated ability to host a variety of heterologous pathways in vivo for a vastly enlarged biochemical work space [\n12\n,\n13\n], and established scale-up capabilities. For example,\nP. putida\nKT2440 has been engineered to grow anoxically [\n14\n], to catabolize novel substrates [\n15\n,\n16\n,\n17\n], and to synthesize a diverse array of chemicals [\n3\n,\n12\n]. Moreover,\nP. putida\nKT2440 has been successfully engineered to utilize both of the common hemicellulosic pentoses: xylose and arabinose [\n18\n,\n19\n,\n20\n]. However,\nP. putida\nKT2440 has not been engineered to catabolize galactose, the next most abundant sugar in many hemicelluloses, which can be up to 3% of total sugars in plant biomass [\n21\n]. It will be important to capture this carbon for an efficient bioconversion process.\nThere are two common pathways for galactose catabolism in bacteria: the Leloir (LL) pathway and the De Ley–Doudoroff (DLD) pathway [\n2\n]. In the LL pathway, galactose is phosphorylated and then converted to glucose-1-phosphate through a cyclic pair of transferase/epimerase reactions with uridyl monophosphate intermediates [\n22\n,\n23\n]. The DLD pathway, on the other hand, mirrors the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway for glucose catabolism used by\nP. putida\nKT2440, wherein the sugar is ultimately converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and pyruvate (PYR) [\n24\n]. The DLD pathway can be separated into three parts: transport (Fig.\n1\na), galactose conversion to galactonate (Fig.\n1\nb), and galactonate to G3P and PYR (Fig.\n1\nc). Transport of galactose into the cell is relatively well studied with numerous sugar transporters reported to have activity on galactose as either a primary or secondary substrate; for example, GalP from\nEscherichia coli\nis a sugar-proton symporter of both galactose and glucose [\n25\n]. The second portion of the DLD pathway, where galactose is converted to galactonate, is less well characterized. Some organisms have been described to have these activities. Although enzymes with dehydrogenase and lactonase activity on galactose and 1,4-galactonolactone have been identified, such as AraAB from\nBurkholderia ambifaria\n, no sequence of a specific galactonolactonase has been identified [\n26\n,\n27\n,\n28\n,\n29\n,\n30\n]. For the last portion of the DLD pathway, three enzymatic steps of dehydration, phosphorylation, and subsequent aldol cleavage are performed by DgoD, DgoK, and DgoA, respectively (Fig.\n1\nc) [\n31\n]. Homologs of these proteins are encoded in a wide variety of organisms, including many pseudomonads such as\nPseudomonas fluorescens\nSBW25. Interestingly, these genes are even encoded in some organisms that use the LL pathway like\nE. coli\n, where the\ndgoKAD\noperon is a separately regulated pathway only for galactonate catabolism. However, to the best of our knowledge, the complete DLD pathway has not been successfully introduced into an organism that does not natively utilize galactose and allowed for growth with galactose as the sole carbon source.\nFig. 1\nComponents of the DLD galactose pathway used in this study.\na\nTransport across the inner membrane, outlined in red.\nb\nGalactose conversion to galactonate, outlined in green.\nc\nGalactonate conversion to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, outlined in blue.\nGalP\ngalactose–proton symporter,\nDgoK\n2-dehydro-3-deoxygalactonokinase,\nDgoA\n2-dehydro-3-deoxy-6-phosphogalactonate aldolase,\nDgoD\nd\n-galactonate dehydratase,\nAraA\nl\n-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase/\nd\n-galactose dehydrogenase,\nAraB\n,\nl\n-arabinolactonase/\nd\n-galactonolactonase\nFull size image\nTo expand the substrate range of\nP. putida\nKT2440 to include galactose, in this study, we harness the less commonly used DLD pathway of galactose catabolism. We chose this pathway because it is observed in pseudomonads, and the products of the DLD pathway (G3P and PYR) are the same as the ED pathway natively used by\nP. putida\nKT2440 for glucose catabolism. Additionally, the DLD pathway catabolizes galactose via different metabolic intermediates relative to glucose, whereas the Leloir pathway uses the exact same intermediates and may compete for the same flux space. Therefore, the DLD pathway might lead to better sugar co-utilization. Here we built a functional DLD pathway using genes from\nE. coli\n,\nP. fluorescens\nSBW25, and\nB. ambifaria\n. We then demonstrated the ability of this strain to utilize galactose alone and co-utilize galactose and glucose.\nResults and discussion\nHeterologous expression of DgoKAD allows growth on galactose\nWild-type\nP. putida\nKT2440 does not grow on galactose or galactonate, so we first explored what portions of the DLD pathway were required for galactose catabolism [\n32\n]. Glucose dehydrogenases in pseudomonads can have a wide substrate range, and there are many uncharacterized and promiscuous sugar transporters in\nP. putida\nKT2440 [\n18\n]. We therefore hypothesized that side activity of native enzymes may be sufficient for galactose transport and conversion to galactonate. Therefore, we introduced a galactonate conversion pathway into the chromosome of\nP. putida\nby expressing the\ndgoKAD\noperon from\nP. fluorescens\nSBW25 under its native promoter, creating strain QP603 (Fig.\n2\na, Table\n1\n). We inoculated strain QP603 into minimal medium with galactose as the sole carbon and energy source and observed slow growth on galactose after a 52-h lag phase (Fig.\n2\nb, Additional file\n1\n: Table S1). No accumulation of galactonate or any other molecule was seen in the supernatant by HPLC. This demonstrates that expression of\ndgoKAD\nis sufficient for galactose catabolism and that native systems must be capable of galactose transport and oxidation to galactonate at a low level.\nFig. 2\nSchematic of strains constructed and their growth on galactose.\na\nPictorial representation of genotypes for strains QP603–QP608 (see “\nMaterials and methods\n” for additional details).\nb\nGrowth of each strain on MME media with 10 mM galactose as the sole carbon source.

Strains were grown at 30 °C aerobically in a 48-well microtiter plate in biological triplicate with measurements every 10 min\nFull size image\nTable 1 Strains and plasmids used in this study\nFull size table\nGrowth rate improved by pathway expansion\nWe next examined improving the growth rate of strain QP603. While the side activity of native enzymes could perform the transport, dehydrogenase, and lactonase activities of the DLD pathway, they could be rate limiting. We therefore introduced enzymes to convert intracellular galactose to galactonate. Because no galactose-specific dehydrogenase and lactonase are yet to be identified, we assembled our pathway using the best-characterized galactonolactonase and its associated galactose dehydrogenase that are currently known—an arabinose dehydrogenase, AraA, and arabinonolactonase, AraB, from the oxidative arabinose pathway of\nB. ambifaria\n[\n26\n,\n27\n,\n30\n]. We introduced codon-optimized versions of\naraA\nand\naraB\ninto strain QP603 at the end of the\ndgoKAD\noperon, resulting in a longer operon of five genes\ndgoKAD:araAB\nand a new strain QP604 (Fig.\n2\na). This strain grew 60% faster than strain QP603 and had a substantially reduced lag phase (Fig.\n2\nb, Additional file\n1\n: Table S1). Unfortunately, strain QP604 still experienced a significant lag of approximately 26 h, and the growth rate was still slower than that of glucose catabolism despite having a similar energetic yield and producing the same central metabolites, G3P and PYR.\nBecause we had introduced all the catabolic parts of the DLD pathway, we hypothesized that growth on galactose may now be limited by substrate uptake. We selected the\nE. coli\nGalP to study the impact of transport on growth rate in strain QP604. A codon-optimized\ngalP\nwas introduced into the BxB1\nattB\nsite of strain QP604 using site-specific recombination with four different promoters to generate strains QP605–QP608 [\n6\n]. Promoters of increasing strength were used to express\ngalP\n, including the upstream regions of PP_1548 and PP_3079 and the\nE. coli lac\nand\ntac\npromoters (Additional file\n1\n: Table S2), resulting in strains QP605 to QP608, respectively. All four strains showed a significantly reduced duration of lag phase (\nP\nvalue < 0.001) and the growth improved in strains QP606–QP608 (\nP\nvalue < 0.01) when compared to the parent QP604 for growth on galactose (Fig.\n2\nb, Additional file\n1\n: Table S1). Expression of\ngalP\nwith the\nlac\npromoter in strain QP607 had the greatest increase in growth rate relative to QP604, 41%, with an overall growth rate of 0.371 ± 0.03 h\n−1\n. This expression optimization for the galactose transporter suggests that growth rate improves with higher\ngalP\nexpression up to the strength of the\nlac\npromoter. However, growth rate decreased when using the very highly expressed\ntac\npromoter, suggesting that overexpression of this transporter can become toxic to our engineered cells. Comparatively, the WT grown under identical conditions but with glucose as the carbon source grew at 0.87 ± 0.09 h\n−1\n, about 2.5-fold faster. Overall, while the introduction of\ndgoKAD\nwas sufficient to supply growth on galactose, the complete DLD pathway including a transporter was required for rapid catabolism of galactose as the sole carbon source.\nGalactose is co-utilized with glucose\nCo-utilization allows for faster and potentially continuous approaches to bioprocessing, making it important for future commercialization. We therefore sought to determine whether galactose could be co-utilized with glucose. To test whether co-utilization indeed occurs, we measured sugar utilization of strain QP607 in shake flasks with equimolar amounts of glucose and galactose. Both glucose and galactose were simultaneously utilized, no additional peaks such as for galactonate accumulation were observed in the supernatant quantification, and the growth of strain QP607 did not have a diauxic shape (Fig.\n3\n). Together, this evidence demonstrates co-utilization of glucose and galactose in strain QP607. It is not surprising strain QP607 was able to co-utilize galactose and glucose simultaneously.\nP. putida\ndoes not natively utilize galactose, so the heterologous DLD pathway should be unregulated in\nP. putida\n. Furthermore, the pathway produces the same products as the natively utilized ED pathway for glucose catabolism, so it was expected the DLD pathway would be able to seamlessly integrate into central metabolism when the strain is growing on glucose. However, we did observe that glucose was utilized more rapidly than galactose in QP607. Fortunately, because galactose is a less abundant sugar than glucose in lignocellulose (approximately 1:30 ratio in corn stover hydrolysate [\n2\n]), the current slower utilization rate of galactose should still be sufficient for most real-world settings. Based on the similarity to the ED pathway and the lack of detected products, the galactose was presumably completely oxidized to CO\n2\nvia the TCA cycle in these strains.\nFig. 3\nShake flask characterization of strain QP607 growth on glucose and galactose. HPLC data for glucose and galactose concentrations are shown in magenta triangles, and cyan squares, respectively. Bacterial growth, as measured by a change in optical density, is shown in black circles\nFull size image\nWhile the current level of pathway functionality is likely sufficient for most applications, additional research could lead to faster galactose catabolism. In this work, we primarily focused on tuning expression of the transporter because although substrate uptake is critical, membrane protein overexpression can be toxic. Similar tuning of the rest of the genes in the pathway could further improve the growth rate. Other approaches such as adaptive laboratory evolution would also likely result in more rapid galactose catabolism. Finally, metabolomics studies could help reveal how the newly introduced DLD pathway integrates with the cyclic EDEMP pathway, which may be critical for future metabolic engineering efforts to divert flux away from growth and toward product formation.\nConclusions\nWe have expanded the potential for total hydrolysate biocatalysis by\nP. putida\nKT2440, an emerging model organism for synthetic biology and biomass valorization, by introducing the DLD pathway for galactose catabolism. In doing so, we have determined the enzymes required for rapid catabolism and optimized the expression level of galactose transport. Furthermore, we have shown that this pathway allows co-consumption of galactose with a preferred substrate such as glucose. This work not only further demonstrates the strength of\nP. putida\nas a modular biocatalysis chassis, but also benefits the community developing bioprocesses for total hydrolysate conversion by expanding the catabolic sugar profile of\nP. putida\n. We plan to expand this work in the future by incorporating the previously demonstrated catabolic pathways for xylose and arabinose into our galactose utilizing strain.\nMaterials and methods\nStrain construction\nPseudomonas putida\nstrain JE90 (\nP. putida\nKT2440\n∆hsdR::BxB1int\n-\nattB\n[\n6\n]) was the parent for all strains made in this study. For the plasmids to insert\ndgoKAD\nand\naraAB\ninto the chromosome, the genes were cloned into pK18mobsacB [\n33\n] flanked by 1 kb sequences identical to the upstream and downstream region of PP_0545, a non-specific aldehyde dehydrogenase. These regions are used for homologous recombination to replace PP_0545 with the pathway genes. Primers were from (Eurofins Genomics, Louisville, KY), and gBlocks for codon-optimized\naraAB\nfrom\nB\n.\nambifaria\nATCC BAA-244 and\ngalP\nfrom\nE\n.\ncoli\nwere synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. Genomic DNA was used to amplify\ndgoKAD\n, and its native promoter from\nP. fluorescens\nSBW25 and gDNA from\nP. putida\nstrain JE90 was amplified using Phusion High Fidelity Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) when relevant. Plasmids were constructed via Gibson assembly with the NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly master mix (New England Biolabs (NEB), Ipswich, MA), DNA was extracted from agarose gels with Zymo gel extraction kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) and transformed into NEB F’I\nQ\nE. coli\nchemically competent cells following the manufacturers guidelines (NEB). Plasmid sequences were confirmed via sequencing by Eurofins Genomics, and annotated plasmid sequences are available in Additional files\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n, and\n7\n. Strain genotypes and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table\n1\n. When necessary, all antibiotic selections were performed with 50 µg/mL kanamycin. Plasmids were harvested with the geneJET miniprep kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For seamless chromosomal editing to introduce\ndgoKAD\nand\naraAB\ncassettes into\nP. putida,\npK18mobsacB-derived plasmids were transformed into\nP. putida\nand mutants were selected using kanamycin selection and sucrose counter-selection as previously described [\n34\n]. The promoter–transporter cassettes were integrated using BxB1 phage integration as previously described [\n6\n].\nGrowth medium\nUtilization of galactose and glucose was tested aerobically in the MOPS-buffered minimal medium MME, which consisted of (per liter): 1.6 g K\n2\nHPO\n4\n·3 H\n2\nO, 4.2 g 3-(\nN\n-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), 0.25 g NaCl, 0.50 g NH\n4\nCl, 0.10 g MgSO\n4\n·7 H\n2\n0, 0.01 g CaCl\n2\n·2 H\n2\nO, and 1 mL of a 1000× trace element solution, which consisted of (per liter): 1.00 mL concentrated HCl, 0.50 g Na\n4\nEDTA·H\n2\nO, 2 g FeCl\n3\n, 0.05 g H\n3\nBO\n3\n, 0.05 g ZnCl\n2\n, 0.03 g CuCl\n2\n·2H\n2\nO, 0.05 g MnCl\n2\n·4H\n2\nO, 0.05 g (NH\n4\n)2MoO\n4\n, 0.05 g CoCl\n2\n·6H\n2\nO, and 0.05 g NiCl\n2\n·6H\n2\nO. Glucose and galactose were added as growth substrates at the concentrations detailed below.\nPlate reader growth assays\nStrains were grown from single colonies in LB overnight at 30 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. Cells were washed in substrate-free MME medium and a 1% inoculum was transferred to MME medium supplemented with 10 mM galactose. After the cells had reached stationary phase, 10 μL of each sample were further passaged into 500 μL MME medium supplemented with 10 mM galactose in a 48-well plate (Greiner Bio-One). Edge wells of the plate were filled with 700 μL media and not used for data collection to minimize the impact of evaporation. Data were collected on an Epoch2 plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) with fast continuous double orbital shaking at 30 °C aerobically. A temperature gradient of 1 °C was added to minimize condensation. Measurement of OD\n600\nwas performed every 10 min. Growth rates were calculated with CurveFitter software [\n35\n] using only linear regions of growth on a log(OD\n600\n) vs time plot, and only OD\n600\nvalues below 25% OD\n600\nmax. The lag phase was also calculated with the CurveFitter software.\nP\nvalues were calculated with Student’s\nt\ntest.\nShake flask growth assay\nStrain QP607 was grown to mid-log phase in MME medium supplemented with 12 mM glucose and 12 mM galactose. The cells were transferred to a 125-mL flask containing 25 mL of the glucose–galactose MME medium at 30 °C with 250-rpm shaking. The cells were monitored for growth, and periodically 1 mL was sampled to measure OD\n600\nand for HPLC analysis.\nGalactose and glucose HPLC quantification\nSamples were filtered with 0.2-μm Corning Costar Spin-X centrifuge tube filters and then acidified with H\n2\nSO\n4\nto a final concentration of 5 mM. The samples were run on a Waters HPLC equipped with refractive index detector and a Supelcogel H 6% column with a 0.6 mL/min flow rate of 5 mM H\n2\nSO\n4\nin water as the running buffer at 60 °C. Sugar concentrations were determined by comparison to a standard curve.\nAvailability of data and materials\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article and its additional information files.\nAbbreviations\nLL pathway:\nLeloir pathway\nDLD pathway:\nDe Ley–Doudoroff pathway\nED pathway:\nEntner–Doudoroff pathway\nG3P:\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate\nPYR:\npyruvate\nReferences\nSaini JK, Saini R, Tewari L.

A yeast will be subject to varied efforts to increase its yield of biochemicals and biofuels. Machine learning will help identify synthetic biology approaches that maximize production.

A biosensor-driven approach to testing will enable high throughput analysis of the effect of host genetics on the production of malonyl-CoA, a key precursor to polyketides. The droplet microfluidics screening and analysis capabilities of the Agile BioFoundry (ABF) at Argonne National Laboratory will provide a wealth of additional information to link metabolite production with host genetics. The large datasets generated in the testing stage will be used as input for deep learning; a new algorithm linking genotypes to phenotypes – DeepMetabolism – will be used to predict a minimal set of genetic perturbations that maximize malonyl-CoA biosynthesis. This data-driven approach will advance both deep learning and high throughput approaches for microbial engineering and can be applied to other strategic metabolites.\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\nPublication:\nNSF Award\nPub Date:\nOctober 2022\nBibcode:\n2022nsf....2225877D",
